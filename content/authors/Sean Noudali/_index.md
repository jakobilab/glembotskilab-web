I joined the TCRC team in June 2021 and am conducting both cellular biology and animal physiology-related research. I have been involved in interdisciplinary academic research since 2015 and in the future, I plan to pursue a doctorate studying genetics and pharmacology. I was born and raised in Arizona and love to hike and be outdoors with my two cattle dogs.
