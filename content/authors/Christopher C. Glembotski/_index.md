Dr. Glembotski is Professor of Medicine at the University of Arizona College of Medicine – Phoenix (UA COMP), where he is also Associate Dean for Research and Director of the Translational Cardiovascular Research Center. Dr. Glembotski earned a B.S. in biochemistry from California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo, CA, and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of California, Los Angeles. After a post-doctoral fellowship in cell and molecular physiology, in the Department of Physiology at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver, Colorado, Dr. Glembotski joined the faculty in the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia, PA., after which he moved to SDSU to become the Director of the SDSU Heart Institute, before moving to his current location at UA COMP.

Dr. Glembotski's current research is in the area of molecular cardiology, with a focus on identifying signaling mechanisms in the heart that regulate the growth and survival of the myocardium during normal and pathological conditions. Recent studies in Dr. Glembotski's lab have led to a better understanding of the heart’s natural defense mechanisms and to the design and implementation of therapeutic approaches to boost these defense mechanisms in order to make the heart more resistant to heart diseases, such as heart failure.
