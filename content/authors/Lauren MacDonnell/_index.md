I began volunteering in Dr. Glembotski’s lab after graduating from San Diego State. That was my first introduction to cardiac research, and I immediately found it fascinating. The first thing I learned in lab was viral production and it has remained a passion of mine ever since. Outside of work I love to spend time outdoors, camping and hiking. If I have to be indoors I am baking, reading, or working on a puzzle!
