abstract: Calcium channels are important in a variety of cellular events including
  muscle contraction, signaling, proliferation, and apoptosis. Sphingolipids have
  been recognized as mediators of intracellular calcium release through their actions
  on a calcium channel, sphingolipid calcium release-mediating protein of the endoplasmic
  reticulum (SCaMPER). The current study investigates the expression and function
  of SCaMPER in cardiomyocytes. Northern analyses and RT-PCR cloning and sequencing
  revealed SCaMPER expression in both human and rat cardiac tissue. Immunofluorescence
  and Western blot analyses demonstrated that SCaMPER is abundant in cardiac tissue
  and is localized to the sarcotubular junction. This was confirmed by the colocalization
  of SCaMPER with dihydropyridine and ryanodine receptors by confocal microscopy.
  Purified T tubules were shown to contain SCaMPER and immunoelectron micrographs
  suggested that SCaMPER is located to the junctional T tubules, but a junctional
  SR localization cannot be ruled out. The sphingolipid ligand for SCaMPER, sphingosylphosphorylcholine
  (SPC), initiated calcium release from the cardiomyocyte SR. Importantly, antisense
  knockdown of SCaMPER mRNA produced a substantial reduction of sphingolipid-induced
  calcium release, suggesting that SCaMPER is a potentially important calcium channel
  of cardiomyocytes.
