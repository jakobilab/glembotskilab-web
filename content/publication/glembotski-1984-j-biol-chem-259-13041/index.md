abstract: Rat intermediate pituitary cells in primary culture display a time-dependent
  loss of the ability to produce COOH-terminally alpha-amidated alpha MSH (Glembotski,
  C.C., Eipper, B.A., and Mains, R.E. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7299-7304). Instead
  of des-, mono-, and diacetyl-adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH) (1-13)NH2, the cells
  produce des-, mono-, and diacetyl-ACTH(1-14)OH. Since the pituitary secretory granule-associated
  alpha-amidation enzyme requires copper and ascorbic acid for optimal activity (Eipper,
  B.A., Mains, R.E., and Glembotski, C. C. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80,
  5144-5148), these cofactors were added to cultures of intermediate pituitary cells
  in an attempt to reverse the loss of peptide alpha-amidation ability. When the cultures
  were supplemented with up to 100 microM cooper (II) there was very little change
  in the ability to alpha-amidate alpha-melanotropin. Ascorbic acid at concentrations
  of up to 500 microM resulted in a dramatic increase in the ability of the cells
  to form the alpha-amidated peptide. Various combinations of ascorbic acid and copper
  additions indicated that a relatively short exposure (hours) to ascorbic acid produced
  the maximal response. Ascorbic acid displayed a dose-dependent effect on the alpha-amidation
  ability with a half-optimal concentration of about 25 microM. Pulse-chase labeling
  experiments demonstrated the ascorbic acid-dependent conversion of labeled ACTH(1-14)OH-related
  peptides to ACTH(1-13)NH2-related peptides. These results correlate with the ascorbic
  acid requirement of the pituitary alpha-amidation enzyme and demonstrate that the
  direct precursors to ACTH(1-13)NH2-related peptides are ACTH(1-14)OH-related peptides.
  Combined with our previous data, the present studies support the notion that a wide
  range of neuro- and endocrine peptides become alpha-amidated in a similar ascorbic
  acid-dependent manner.
