abstract: Bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is responsible for the multiorgan
  dysfunction that characterizes septic shock and is causal in the myocardial depression
  that is a common feature of endotoxemia in patients. In this setting the myocardial
  dysfunction appears to be due, in part, to the production of proinflammatory cytokines.
  A line of evidence also indicates that LPS stimulates autophagy in cardiomyocytes.
  However, the signal transduction pathway leading to autophagy and its role in the
  heart are incompletely characterized. In this work, we wished to determine the effect
  of LPS on autophagy and the physiological significance of the autophagic response.
  Autophagy was monitored morphologically and biochemically in HL-1 cardiomyocytes,
  neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and transgenic mouse hearts after the administration
  of bacterial LPS or TNF-alpha. We observed that autophagy was increased after exposure
  to LPS or TNF-alpha, which is induced by LPS. The inhibition of TNF-alpha production
  by AG126 significantly reduced the accumulation of autophagosomes both in cell culture
  and in vivo. The inhibition of p38 MAPK or nitric oxide synthase by pharmacological
  inhibitors also reduced autophagy. Nitric oxide or H(2)O(2) induced autophagy in
  cardiomyocytes, whereas N-acetyl-cysteine, a potent antioxidant, suppressed autophagy.
  LPS resulted in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and decreased
  total glutathione. To test the hypothesis that autophagy might serve as a damage
  control mechanism to limit further ROS production, we induced autophagy with rapamycin
  before LPS exposure. The activation of autophagy by rapamycin suppressed LPS-mediated
  ROS production and protected cells against LPS toxicity. These findings support
  the notion that autophagy is a cytoprotective response to LPS-induced cardiomyocyte
  injury; additional studies are needed to determine the therapeutic implications.
