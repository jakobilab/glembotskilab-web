abstract: A study by Rybkin et al. (see p. 527) substantially advances our understanding
  of regulated exocytois by specialized secretory cells, such as atrial myocytes.
  A second member of the Ras-related protein family, RRP17, was identified and shown
  to participate in regulating the secretion of the cardiac-derived peptide hormone,
  atrial natriuretic peptide. In addition to the heart, RRP17 was shown to be expressed
  in neuronal, pancreatic, and skeletal muscle cells, suggesting a widespread role
  in regulated secretion for this new protein.
