 abstract = {A study by Rybkin et al. (see p. 527) substantially advances our understanding of regulated exocytois by specialized secretory cells, such as atrial myocytes. A second member of the Ras-related protein family, RRP17, was identified and shown to participate in regulating the secretion of the cardiac-derived peptide hormone, atrial natriuretic peptide. In addition to the heart, RRP17 was shown to be expressed in neuronal, pancreatic, and skeletal muscle cells, suggesting a widespread role in regulated secretion for this new protein.},
