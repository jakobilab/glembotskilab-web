abstract: GATA-binding proteins are transcription factors that regulate the stage-
  and tissue-specific expression of globin genes in cells of the erythroid lineage.
  Recently, a cardiac GATA-binding protein was found to be the earliest gene expressed
  during cardiogenesis; however, the target genes of this transcription factor in
  the heart are unknown. Since brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is activated early
  in cardiac growth and development, we evaluated whether it could serve as a target
  gene for GATA-binding protein-mediated induction. Upon isolating and sequencing
  2.5 kilobases of the rat BNP 5'-flanking sequence (FS), a variety of putative transcriptional
  enhancer sites were identified, including several GATA consensus sequences (WGATAR),
  one of which apparently serves as the major promoter site. Primary myocardial cells
  were transfected with BNP/luciferase fusion genes; reporter expression was strongly
  induced by typical growth factors such as phorbol esters, serum, or alpha 1-adrenergic
  agonists, as well as by GATA-4 overexpression. Truncation analyses showed that inducibility
  mapped primarily to the proximal -116 base pair of the rat BNP 5'-FS, where there
  are two consensus GATA sites in addition to the GATA sequence at the TATA box. Point
  mutation analyses showed that at least one of the GATA sites was required to confer
  full GATA-4-inducible transcription. These results demonstrate that a proximal region
  of the rat BNP 5'-FS is required for growth factor- and GATA-inducible transcription,
  supporting the view that the BNP gene could serve as a target for GATA-binding proteins
  during early cardiac development.
