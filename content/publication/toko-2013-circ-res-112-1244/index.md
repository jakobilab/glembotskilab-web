abstract: 'RATIONALE: Cardiac hypertrophy results from the complex interplay of differentially
  regulated cascades based on the phosphorylation status of involved signaling molecules.
  Although numerous critical regulatory kinases and phosphatases have been identified
  in the myocardium, the intracellular mechanism for temporal regulation of signaling
  duration and intensity remains obscure. In the nonmyocyte context, control of folding,
  activity, and stability of proteins is mediated by the prolyl isomerase Pin1, but
  the role of Pin1 in the heart is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To establish the role of Pin1
  in the heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we show that either genetic deletion or
  cardiac overexpression of Pin1 blunts hypertrophic responses induced by transaortic
  constriction and consequent cardiac failure in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that
  Pin1 directly binds to Akt, mitogen activated protein kinase (MEK), and Raf-1 in
  cultured cardiomyocytes after hypertrophic stimulation. Furthermore, loss of Pin1
  leads to diminished hypertrophic signaling of Akt and MEK, whereas overexpression
  of Pin1 increases Raf-1 phosphorylation on the autoinhibitory site Ser259, leading
  to reduced MEK activation. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data support a role
  for Pin1 as a central modulator of the intensity and duration of 2 major hypertrophic
  signaling pathways, thereby providing a novel target for regulation and control
  of cardiac hypertrophy.'
