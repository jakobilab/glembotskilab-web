abstract: The heart exhibits incredible plasticity in response to both environmental
  and genetic alterations that affect workload. Over the course of development, or
  in response to physiological or pathological stimuli, the heart responds to fluctuations
  in workload by hypertrophic growth primarily by individual cardiac myocytes growing
  in size. Cardiac hypertrophy is associated with an increase in protein synthesis,
  which must coordinate with protein folding and degradation to allow for homeostatic
  growth without affecting the functional integrity of cardiac myocytes (i.e., proteostasis).
  This increase in the protein folding demand in the growing cardiac myocyte activates
  the transcription factor, ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6Î±, an inducer of
  genes that restore proteostasis. Previously, ATF6 has been shown to induce ER-targeted
  proteins functioning primarily to enhance ER protein folding and degradation. More
  recent studies, however, have illuminated adaptive roles for ATF6 functioning outside
  of the ER by inducing non-canonical targets in a stimulus-specific manner. This
  unique ability of ATF6 to act as an initial adaptive responder has bolstered an
  enthusiasm for identifying small molecule activators of ATF6 and similar proteostasis-based
  therapeutics.
