abstract: In the present study, cis elements in the 5'-flanking sequence (FS) of the
  rat atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene involved in regulating basal and alpha
  1-adrenergic-inducible transcription were investigated. Truncation analyses using
  ANF-luciferase reporter constructs transfected into primary neonatal rat cardiac
  myocytes showed that an A/T-rich serum response element (SRE) at -114 bp of the
  ANF 5'-FS, which bound serum response factor (SRF), was required for basal and inducible
  transcription. In constructs composed of 134 bp of rat ANF 5'-FS driving luciferase
  (ANF-134Luc), mutations in the SRE at -114 bp disrupted SRF binding and ANF promoter
  activity. However, the same mutations in ANF-638Luc had little effect, suggesting
  a collaborating role for more distal sequences, such as the other SRE in ANF-638
  at -406 bp. In ANF-638Luc, mutations in the SRE at -406 bp that disrupted SRF binding
  to that site decreased ANF reporter activity by only 25%; however, mutating both
  of the SREs completely blocked alpha 1-adrenergic-inducible activity. Mutation analyses
  showed that an ... (SP-1)-like site at -69 bp, shown previously to confer inducibility
  in reporters with 134 bp of ANF 5'-FS, was not required in ANF-638Luc. However,
  double mutants in the SP-1-like region and either SRE completely blocked alpha 1-adrenergic-inducible
  ANF promoter activity. These findings emphasize that no single element is responsible
  for alpha 1-adrenergic agonist-regulated ANF transcription but that the SREs at
  -114 and -406 bp and the SP-1-like sequence at -69 bp mediate the effect in collaboration.
