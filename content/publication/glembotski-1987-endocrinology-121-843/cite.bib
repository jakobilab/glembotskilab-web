 abstract = {The biochemical and morphological characteristics of primary neonatal rat atrial myocytes were examined in order to establish a model system for future studies of the biosynthesis and secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Preliminary studies demonstrated that the quantity of immunoactive ANP/microgram protein within rat atria increased as a function of age from 2 ng/micrograms in 19 day prenatal animals to 400 ng/micrograms in the adult. Gel filtration, reversed phase HPLC, and ion exchange HPLC indicated that there were similar quantities of immunoactive ANP in the right and left atria at various ages, and that the major molecular form of the peptide in the heart is chromatographically indistinguishable from ANP(1-126). Cultures of dissociated cells were prepared from pooled left and right atria derived from 1 day postnatal animals. A complete serum-free medium was developed which resulted in the maintenance of high levels of immunoactive ANP in the cultures. As determined by RIA, the cellular content of ANP increased in the cultures as a function of time through 7 days in vitro. The quantity of immunoactive ANP in the cultures increased approximately 2- to 3-fold between days 3 and 7. When the cultures that had been maintained for 7 days were submitted to immunocytochemistry using an ANP-specific monoclonal antibody, distinct colonies of spindle-shaped cells stained positively. In situ hybridization, utilizing an 35S-labeled ANP messenger RNA probe, demonstrated that these colonies of myocytes expressed the ANP message. Using quantitative dot-blot hybridization it was shown that the ANP mRNA level increased approximately 50-fold between days 1 and 7 in culture. These studies indicate that the serum-free culture medium allows continued accumulation of both ANP and the ANP message in culture and will provide a useful model system to characterize factors that regulate the biosynthesis and secretion of this hormone.},
