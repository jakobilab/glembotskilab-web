abstract: The biochemical and morphological characteristics of primary neonatal rat
  atrial myocytes were examined in order to establish a model system for future studies
  of the biosynthesis and secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Preliminary
  studies demonstrated that the quantity of immunoactive ANP/microgram protein within
  rat atria increased as a function of age from 2 ng/micrograms in 19 day prenatal
  animals to 400 ng/micrograms in the adult. Gel filtration, reversed phase HPLC,
  and ion exchange HPLC indicated that there were similar quantities of immunoactive
  ANP in the right and left atria at various ages, and that the major molecular form
  of the peptide in the heart is chromatographically indistinguishable from ANP(1-126).
  Cultures of dissociated cells were prepared from pooled left and right atria derived
  from 1 day postnatal animals. A complete serum-free medium was developed which resulted
  in the maintenance of high levels of immunoactive ANP in the cultures. As determined
  by RIA, the cellular content of ANP increased in the cultures as a function of time
  through 7 days in vitro. The quantity of immunoactive ANP in the cultures increased
  approximately 2- to 3-fold between days 3 and 7. When the cultures that had been
  maintained for 7 days were submitted to immunocytochemistry using an ANP-specific
  monoclonal antibody, distinct colonies of spindle-shaped cells stained positively.
  In situ hybridization, utilizing an 35S-labeled ANP messenger RNA probe, demonstrated
  that these colonies of myocytes expressed the ANP message. Using quantitative dot-blot
  hybridization it was shown that the ANP mRNA level increased approximately 50-fold
  between days 1 and 7 in culture. These studies indicate that the serum-free culture
  medium allows continued accumulation of both ANP and the ANP message in culture
  and will provide a useful model system to characterize factors that regulate the
  biosynthesis and secretion of this hormone.
