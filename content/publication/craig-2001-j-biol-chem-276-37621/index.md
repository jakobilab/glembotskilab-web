abstract: Many cell types mount elaborate, compensatory responses to stress that enhance
  survival; however, the intracellular signals that govern these responses are poorly
  understood. Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), a stress-induced cytokine, belongs to the interleukin-6/glycoprotein
  130 receptor-coupled cytokine family. CT-1 is released from the heart in response
  to hypoxic stress, and it protects cardiac myocytes from hypoxia-induced apoptosis,
  thus establishing a central role for this cytokine in the cardiac stress response.
  In the present study, CT-1 activated p38 and ERK MAPKs as well as Akt in cultured
  cardiac myocytes; these three pathways were activated in a parallel manner. CT-1
  also induced the degradation of the NF-kappa B cytosolic anchor, I kappa B, as well
  as the translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B to the nucleus and increased
  expression of an NF-kappa B-dependent reporter gene. Inhibitors of the p38, ERK,
  or Akt pathways each partially reduced CT-1-mediated NF-kappa B activation, as well
  as the cytoprotective effects of CT-1 against hypoxic stress. Together, the inhibitors
  completely blocked CT-1-dependent NF-kappa B activation and cytoprotection. A cell-permeable
  peptide that selectively disrupted NF-kappa B activation also completely inhibited
  the cytoprotective effects of CT-1. These results indicate that CT-1 signals through
  p38, ERK, and Akt in a parallel manner to activate NF-kappa B and that NF-kappa
  B is required for CT-1 to mediate its full cytoprotective effects in cardiac myocytes.
