abstract: 'RATIONALE: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress dysregulates ER proteostasis,
  which activates the transcription factor, ATF6 (activating transcription factor
  6α), an inducer of genes that enhance protein folding and restore ER proteostasis.
  Because of increased protein synthesis, it is possible that protein folding and
  ER proteostasis are challenged during cardiac myocyte growth. However, it is not
  known whether ATF6 is activated, and if so, what its function is during hypertrophic
  growth of cardiac myocytes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the activity and function of ATF6
  during cardiac hypertrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS: We found that ER stress and ATF6
  were activated and ATF6 target genes were induced in mice subjected to an acute
  model of transverse aortic constriction, or to free-wheel exercise, both of which
  promote adaptive cardiac myocyte hypertrophy with preserved cardiac function. Cardiac
  myocyte-specific deletion of Atf6 (ATF6 cKO [conditional knockout]) blunted transverse
  aortic constriction and exercise-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and impaired
  cardiac function, demonstrating a role for ATF6 in compensatory myocyte growth.
  Transcript profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation identified RHEB (Ras homologue
  enriched in brain) as an ATF6 target gene in the heart. RHEB is an activator of
  mTORC1 (mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1), a major inducer of
  protein synthesis and subsequent cell growth. Both transverse aortic constriction
  and exercise upregulated RHEB, activated mTORC1, and induced cardiac hypertrophy
  in wild type mouse hearts but not in ATF6 cKO hearts. Mechanistically, knockdown
  of ATF6 in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes blocked phenylephrine- and IGF1 (insulin-like
  growth factor 1)-mediated RHEB induction, mTORC1 activation, and myocyte growth,
  all of which were restored by ectopic RHEB expression. Moreover, adeno-associated
  virus 9- RHEB restored cardiac growth to ATF6 cKO mice subjected to transverse aortic
  constriction. Finally, ATF6 induced RHEB in response to growth factors, but not
  in response to other activators of ATF6 that do not induce growth, indicating that
  ATF6 target gene induction is stress specific. CONCLUSIONS: Compensatory cardiac
  hypertrophy activates ER stress and ATF6, which induces RHEB and activates mTORC1.
  Thus, ATF6 is a previously unrecognized link between growth stimuli and mTORC1-mediated
  cardiac growth.'
