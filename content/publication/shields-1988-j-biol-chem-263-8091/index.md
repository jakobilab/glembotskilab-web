abstract: Primary cultures of neonatal rat atrial myocytes were maintained in two
  different serum-free media for up to 25 days. Reversed-phase high performance liquid
  chromatography coupled with atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)-specific radioimmunoassay
  demonstrated that the cultures maintained in our previously described serum-free
  medium (Glembotski, C.C., and Gibson, T. R. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.
  132, 1008-1017) secreted primarily ANF-(1-126)-like material, whereas those cultures
  maintained in a different formulation of medium secreted mostly ANF-(99-126)-like
  material. Cultures that secreted ANF(99-126)-like material were biosynthetically
  labeled with [35S]cysteine followed by immunoprecipitation of secreted ANF and analysis
  by reversed-phase, size exclusion, and ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography.
  The labeled ANF-(99-126)-like peptide was shown to be chromatographically indistinguishable
  from other synthetic peptides related to ANF-(99-126). Labeled ANF purified from
  extracts of the cultured cells was chromatographically indistinguishable from authentic
  ANF-(1-126), and could be cleaved specifically by thrombin into labeled ANF-(99-126)-like
  material. These results indicate that primary atrial myocytes maintained under certain
  serum-free conditions are capable of secreting ANF-related material that is chromatographically
  indistinguishable from ANF-(99-126), the known circulating form of the hormone.
  Additional preliminary studies suggest that the presence of glucocorticoids in the
  culture medium may confer ANF processing ability on cultured myocytes.
