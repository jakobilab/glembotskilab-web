abstract: Exposing cells to conditions that modulate growth can impair endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) protein folding, leading to ER stress and activation of the transcription
  factor, ATF6. ATF6 binds to ER stress response elements in target genes, inducing
  expression of proteins that enhance the ER protein folding capacity, which helps
  overcome the stress and foster survival. To examine the mechanism of ATF6-mediated
  survival in vivo, we developed a transgenic mouse model that expresses a novel conditionally
  activated form of ATF6. We previously showed that activating ATF6 protected the
  hearts of ATF6 transgenic mice from ER stresses. In the present study, transcript
  profiling identified modulatory calcineurin interacting protein-1 (MCIP1), also
  known as regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), as a novel ATF6-inducible gene that
  encodes a known regulator of calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-mediated
  growth and development in many tissues. The ability of ATF6 to induce RCAN1 in vivo
  was replicated in cultured cardiac myocytes, where adenoviral (AdV)-mediated overexpression
  of activated ATF6 induced the RCAN1 promoter, up-regulated RCAN1 mRNA, inhibited
  calcineurin phosphatase activity, and exerted a striking growth modulating effect
  that was inhibited by RCAN1-targeted small interfering RNA. These results demonstrate
  that RCAN1 is a novel ATF6 target gene that may coordinate growth and ER stress
  signaling pathways. By modulating growth, RCAN1 may reduce the need for ER protein
  folding, thus helping to overcome the stress and enhance survival. Moreover, these
  results suggest that RCAN1 may also be a novel integrator of growth and ER stress
  signaling in many other tissues that depend on calcineurin/NFAT signaling for optimal
  growth and development.
