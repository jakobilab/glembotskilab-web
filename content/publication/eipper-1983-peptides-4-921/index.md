abstract: A secretory granule-associated enzymatic activity that converts mono-[125I]-D-Tyr-Val-Gly
  into mono-[125I]-D-Tyr-Val-NH2 has been studied. The activity is primarily soluble
  and shows optimal activity at pH 7 to pH 8. Amidation activity was stimulated 9-fold
  by addition of optimal amounts of copper (3 microM). In the presence of optimal
  copper, ascorbate stimulated the reaction 7-fold; none of the other reduced or oxidized
  cofactors tested was as effective. Taking into account the dependence of the reaction
  on ascorbate and molecular oxygen and the production of glyoxylate [2], it is suggested
  that the alpha-amidation enzyme is a monooxygenase. Lineweaver Burk plots with D-Tyr-Val-Gly
  as the varied substrate demonstrated Michelis-Menten type kinetics with the values
  of Km and Vmax increasing with the addition of ascorbate to the assay. A variety
  of peptides ending with a COOH-terminal Gly residue act as inhibitors of the reaction.
  Two synthetic peptides, gamma 2MSH and ACTH(1-14), with carboxyl termini similar
  to the presumed physiological substrates for the enzyme, act as competitive inhibitors
  with similar K1 values. It is likely that this secretory granule alpha-amidation
  activity is involved in the physiological biosynthetic alpha-amidation of a wide
  range of bioactive peptides.
