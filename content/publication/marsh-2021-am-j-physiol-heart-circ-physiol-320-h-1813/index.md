abstract: Although peroxisomes have been extensively studied in other cell types,
  their presence and function have gone virtually unexamined in cardiac myocytes.
  Here, in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) we showed that several known peroxisomal
  proteins co-localize to punctate structures with a morphology typical of peroxisomes.
  Surprisingly, we found that the peroxisomal protein, fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1
  (FAR1), was upregulated by pharmacological and pathophysiological ER stress induced
  by tunicamycin (TM) and simulated ischemia-reperfusion (sI/R), respectively. Moreover,
  FAR1 induction in NRVM was mediated by the ER stress sensor, activating transcription
  factor 6 (ATF6). Functionally, FAR1 knockdown reduced myocyte death during oxidative
  stress induced by either sI/R or hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Thus, Far1 is an
  ER stress-inducible gene, which encodes a protein that localizes to peroxisomes
  of cardiac myocytes, where it reduces myocyte viability during oxidative stress.
  Since FAR1 is critical for plasmalogen synthesis, these results imply that plasmalogens
  may exert maladaptive effects on the viability of myocytes exposed to oxidative
  stress.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The peroxisomal enzyme, FAR1, was shown to be an ER stress-
  and ATF6-inducible protein that localizes to peroxisomes in cardiac myocytes. FAR1
  decreases myocyte viability during oxidative stress.
