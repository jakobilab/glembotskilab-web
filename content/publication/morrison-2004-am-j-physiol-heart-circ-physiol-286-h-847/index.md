abstract: Overexpression studies have shown that the small heat shock proteins (sHSP)
  protect the myocardium from ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced damage. However,
  gene deletion studies are necessary to demonstrate whether sHSPs are required for
  protection. The genes for alphaB-crystallin (alphaBC) and HSPB2, two sHSPs that
  are expressed in high levels in the heart, are in close proximity to one another;
  as a result, both genes were disrupted in a recently generated knockout (KO) mouse
  line. The alphaBC/HSPB2 KO mouse line is currently the only model that features
  disruption of sHSPs normally expressed in the heart. Accordingly, we examined the
  cardiac morphology, function, and response to I/R-induced stress in alphaBC-HSPB2
  KO mice. Initial gross, light microscopic and echocardiographic characterization
  showed that the morphological and functional properties of hearts from adult KO
  mice were indistinguishable from age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Electron microscopy
  showed that, compared with WT mouse hearts, KO mouse heart sarcomeres were relatively
  normal. Isolated perfused KO mouse hearts displayed normal contractility; however,
  when compared with WT, after I/R, KO mouse hearts exhibited a twofold reduction
  in contractile recovery, as well as increased necrosis and apoptosis. Additionally,
  when compared with WT, KO mouse hearts exhibited 43% less reduced glutathione, which
  is known to protect from I/R-induced damage. Thus, whereas neither alphaBC nor HSPB2
  is essential for myocardial development and function under nonstressful conditions,
  one or both are required for maximal functional recovery and protection from I/R-induced
  necrosis and apoptosis.
