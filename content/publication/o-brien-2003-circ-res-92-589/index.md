abstract: Generation of proapoptotic sphingolipids by neutral sphingomyelinase activation
  is an early response to hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR) in cardiomyocytes. Factor associated
  with neutral sphingomyelinase activation (FAN) mediates activation of sphingomyelinase
  and subsequent apoptosis. However, the participation of FAN in HR-induced cardiomyocyte
  cell death has not been elucidated. We therefore investigated the expression and
  role of FAN in rat cardiomyocytes. A cDNA was isolated from rat heart encoding putative
  rat FAN. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunoelectron microscopy,
  and immunofluorescence demonstrated for the first time the expression of FAN specifically
  in rat cardiomyocytes. FAN expression was confirmed by the finding that expression
  of a dominant-negative FAN almost completely abrogated HR-induced cell death, whereas
  overexpression of wild-type FAN led to an increase. Treatment of FAN and dominant-negative
  FAN--expressing cells with C2-ceramide produced substantial cell death, indicating
  dominant-negative FAN exerts its protective action by interfering with the activation
  of the sphingolipid cascade. Taking these results together, we conclude that FAN
  is a previously undescribed and important HR signaling component in the heart and
  that inhibition of FAN may provide a novel intervention point for reducing ischemia/reperfusion
  injury.
