abstract: Pharmacologic arm-selective unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathway
  activation is emerging as a promising strategy to ameliorate imbalances in endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) proteostasis implicated in diverse diseases. The small molecule N-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenylpropanamide
  (147) was previously identified (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib35\">Plate et
  al., 2016</xref>) to preferentially activate the ATF6 arm of the UPR, promoting
  protective remodeling of the ER proteostasis network. Here we show that 147-dependent
  ATF6 activation requires metabolic oxidation to form an electrophile that preferentially
  reacts with ER proteins. Proteins covalently modified by 147 include protein disulfide
  isomerases (PDIs), known to regulate ATF6 activation. Genetic depletion of PDIs
  perturbs 147-dependent induction of the ATF6-target gene, BiP, implicating covalent
  modifications of PDIs in the preferential activation of ATF6 afforded by treatment
  with 147. Thus, 147 is a pro-drug that preferentially activates ATF6 signaling through
  a mechanism involving localized metabolic activation and selective covalent modification
  of ER resident proteins that regulate ATF6 activity.
