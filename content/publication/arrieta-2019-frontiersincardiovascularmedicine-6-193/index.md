abstract: The integrity of the proteome in cardiac myocytes is critical for robust
  heart function. Proteome integrity in all cells is managed by protein homeostasis
  or proteostasis, which encompasses processes that maintain the balance of protein
  synthesis, folding, and degradation in ways that allow cells to adapt to conditions
  that present a potential challenge to viability (1). While there are processes in
  various cellular locations in cardiac myocytes that contribute to proteostasis,
  those in the cytosol, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have dominant
  roles in maintaining cardiac contractile function. Cytosolic proteostasis has been
  reviewed elsewhere (2, 3); accordingly, this review focuses on proteostasis in the
  ER and mitochondria, and how they might influence each other and, thus, impact heart
  function in the settings of cardiac physiology and disease.
