abstract: Deletion of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CaMKIIδ)
  has been shown to protect against in vivo ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. It
  remains unclear which CaMKIIδ isoforms and downstream mechanisms are responsible
  for the salutary effects of CaMKIIδ gene deletion. In this study we sought to compare
  the roles of the CaMKIIδ(B) and CaMKIIδ(C) subtypes and the mechanisms by which
  they contribute to ex vivo I/R damage. WT, CaMKIIδKO, and mice expressing only CaMKIIδ(B)
  or δ(C) were subjected to ex vivo global ischemia for 25min followed by reperfusion.
  Infarct formation was assessed at 60min reperfusion by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride
  (TTC) staining. Deletion of CaMKIIδ conferred significant protection from ex vivo
  I/R. Re-expression of CaMKIIδ(C) in the CaMKIIδKO background reversed this effect
  and exacerbated myocardial damage and dysfunction following I/R, while re-expression
  of CaMKIIδ(B) was protective. Selective activation of CaMKIIδ(C) in response to
  I/R was evident in a subcellular fraction enriched for cytosolic/membrane proteins.
  Further studies demonstrated differential regulation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) expression
  by CaMKIIδ(B) and CaMKIIδ(C). Selective activation of CaMKIIδ(C) was also observed
  and associated with NF-κB activation in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs)
  subjected to oxidative stress. Pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB or TNF-α significantly
  ameliorated infarct formation in WT mice and those that re-express CaMKIIδ(C), demonstrating
  distinct roles for CaMKIIδ subtypes in I/R and implicating acute activation of CaMKIIδ(C)
  and NF-κB in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury.
