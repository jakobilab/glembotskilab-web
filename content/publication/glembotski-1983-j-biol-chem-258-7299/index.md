abstract: The structures of the altered alpha-melanotropin (alpha MSH or alpha-N-acetyl-ACTH(1-13)NH2)-related
  molecules produced by cultured rat intermediate pituitary cells were investigated.
  Peptide analyses demonstrated that the alpha MSH-related molecules produced by acutely
  prepared intermediate pituitary cells were primarily des-, mono-, and diacetylated
  ACTH(1-13)NH2; in contrast, longer term cultures produced primarily des-, mono-,
  and diacetylated ACTH(1-14)OH. No significant amount of labeled ACTH(1-13)OH-related
  material was observed under any incubation conditions. Intermediate pituitary cells
  in culture stopped producing alpha-amidated alpha MSH-related molecules with a half-time
  of approximately 15 to 18 h; instead, ACTH(1-14)OH-related molecules were synthesized.
  In several pulse-chase experiments, performed under conditions where cultured intermediate
  pituitary cells were capable of synthesizing alpha MSH-related molecules terminating
  in -Val13-NH2, labeled molecules ending in -Val13-Gly14-OH were not found to give
  rise to major amounts of labeled molecules ending in -Val13-NH2. This failure to
  observe conversion of glycine-extended molecules into alpha-amidated products was
  not due to selective secretion from the cells, since the acetylation and amidation
  states of labeled molecules that were secreted under basal conditions reflected
  those of the molecules stored in the cells, and the basal rate of secretion was
  very low.
