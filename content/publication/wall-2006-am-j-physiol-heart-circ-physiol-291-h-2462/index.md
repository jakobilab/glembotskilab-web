abstract: Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) has critical consequences in the heart. Recent
  studies on the functions of I/R-activated kinases, such as p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), showed that I/R injury is reduced in the hearts of transgenic
  mice that overexpress the p38 MAPK activator MAPK kinase 6 (MKK6). This protection
  may be fostered by changes in the levels of many proteins not currently known to
  be regulated by p38. To examine this possibility, we employed the multidimensional
  protein identification technology MudPIT to characterize changes in levels of proteins
  in MKK6 transgenic mouse hearts, focusing on proteins in mitochondria, which play
  key roles in mediating I/R injury in the heart. Of the 386 mitochondrial proteins
  identified, the levels of 58 were decreased, while only 2 were increased in the
  MKK6 transgenic mouse hearts. Among those that were decreased were 21 mitochondrial
  oxidative phosphorylation complex proteins, which was unexpected because p38 is
  not known to mediate such decreases. Immunoblotting verified that proteins in each
  of the five oxidative phosphorylation complexes were reduced in MKK6 mouse hearts.
  On assessing functional consequences of these reductions, we found that MKK6 mouse
  heart mitochondria exhibited 50% lower oxidative respiration and I/R-mediated reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) generation, both of which are predicted consequences of decreased
  oxidative phosphorylation complex proteins. Thus the cardioprotection observed in
  MKK6 transgenic mouse hearts may be partly due to decreased electron transport,
  which is potentially beneficial, because damaging ROS are known to be generated
  by mitochondrial complexes I and III during reoxygenation.
