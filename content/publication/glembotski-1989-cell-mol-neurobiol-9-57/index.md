abstract: 1. Aim. The biochemical characteristics of atrial natriuretic peptide receptors
  (ANP-R) derived from rat vascular smooth muscle (A-10 cell line) and central nervous
  system (CNS; olfactory bulb) tissue were compared. 2. Method and Results. ANP-Rs
  from each source were solubilized with 40 to 65% efficiency utilizing the nonionic
  detergent Lubrol-PX. Upon solubilization, the ANP-R from each source maintained
  the ability to bind 125I-ANP (99-126) with a high affinity; Scatchard analysis indicated
  that the VSMC ANP-R displayed a Kd for the radioligand of approximately 10 pM, whereas
  the olfactory receptor possessed a Kd of about 165 pM. The Bmax values for the soluble
  VSMC and olfactory ANP-Rs were 285 and 30 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Competition
  binding studies indicated that the VSMC ANP-R bound ANP(99-126), ANP(103-126), and
  ANP(103-123) with similar affinities, whereas the olfactory ANP-R was much more
  sensitive to changes in the COOH-terminal structure of the competing peptide. The
  soluble ANP-Rs from VSMC and olfactory were chromatographically indistinguishable
  on phenyl-, DEAE-, and wheat germ agglutinin-agarose columns. However, the ANP-Rs
  could be distinguished using GTP-agarose; the olfactory ANP-R was capable of binding
  to the resin, whereas the VSMC ANP-R was not. 3. Conclusions. Coupled with other
  studies, these data suggest that the A10 VSMC ANP-R observed in this study may not
  be coupled to guanylate cyclase and may represent a receptor serving a clearance
  function, whereas a significant proportion of the olfactory CNS ANP-R appears to
  be associated with GTP-binding proteins, likely particulate guanylate cyclase, and
  probably represents a coupled form of the receptor.
