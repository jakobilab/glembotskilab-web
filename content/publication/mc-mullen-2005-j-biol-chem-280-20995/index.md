abstract: Pathological conditions such as hypertension and hyperglycemia as well as
  abrasions following balloon angioplasty all lead to endothelial dysfunction that
  impacts disease morbidity. These conditions are associated with the elaboration
  of a variety of cytokines and increases in p38 activity in endothelial cells. However,
  the relationship between enhanced p38 activity and endothelial cell function remains
  poorly understood. To investigate the effect of enhanced p38 MAPK activity on endothelial
  cell function, we expressed an activated mutant of MEK6 (MEK6E), an upstream regulator
  of p38. Expression of MEK6E activated p38 and resulted in phosphorylation of its
  downstream substrate, heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27). Activation of p38 was not sufficient
  to induce apoptosis; however, it did induce p38-dependent cell cycle arrest. MEK6E
  expression was sufficient to inhibit ERK phosphorylation triggered by growth factors
  and integrin engagement. MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) expression was increased upon
  p38 activation, and expression of a \"substrate-trapping\" MKP-1 was sufficient
  to restore ERK activity. Activation of p38 was sufficient to induce cell migration,
  which was accompanied by alterations in actin architecture characterized by enhanced
  lamellipodia. Co-expression of a mutant form of Hsp27, lacking all three phosphorylation
  sites, reversed MEK6E-induced cell migration and altered the cytoskeletal changes
  induced by p38 activation. Collectively, these results suggest that cellular decisions
  regarding migration and proliferation are influenced by p38 activity and that prolonged
  activation of p38 may result in an anti-angiogenic phenotype that contributes to
  endothelial dysfunction.
