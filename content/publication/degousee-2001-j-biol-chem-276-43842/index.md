abstract: Group IIa phospholipase A(2) (GIIa PLA(2)) is released by some cells in
  response to interleukin-1beta. The purpose of this study was to determine whether
  interleukin-1beta would stimulate the synthesis and release of GIIa PLA(2) from
  cardiomyocytes, and to define the role of p38 MAPK and cytosolic PLA(2) in the regulation
  of this process. Whereas GIIa PLA(2) mRNA was not identified in untreated cells,
  exposure to interleukin-1beta resulted in the sustained expression of GIIa PLA(2)
  mRNA. Interleukin-1beta also stimulated a progressive increase in cellular and extracellular
  GIIa PLA(2) protein levels and increased extracellular PLA(2) activity 70-fold.
  In addition, interleukin-1beta stimulated the p38 MAPK-dependent activation of the
  downstream MAPK-activated protein kinase, MAPKAP-K2. Treatment with the p38 MAPK
  inhibitor, SB202190, decreased interleukin-1beta stimulated MAPKAP-K2 activity,
  GIIa PLA(2) mRNA expression, GIIa PLA(2) protein synthesis, and the release of extracellular
  PLA(2) activity. Infection with an adenovirus encoding a constitutively active form
  of MKK6, MKK6(Glu), which selectively phosphorylates p38 MAPK, induced cellular
  GIIa PLA(2) protein synthesis and the release of GIIa PLA(2) and increased extracellular
  PLA(2) activity 3-fold. In contrast, infection with an adenovirus encoding a phosphorylation-resistant
  MKK6, MKK6(A), did not result in GIIa PLA(2) protein synthesis or release by unstimulated
  cardiomyocytes. In addition, infection with an adenovirus encoding MKK6(A) abrogated
  GIIa PLA(2) protein synthesis and release by interleukin-1beta-stimulated cells.
  These results provide direct evidence that p38 MAPK activation was necessary for
  interleukin-1beta-induced synthesis and release of GIIa PLA(2) by cardiomyocytes.
