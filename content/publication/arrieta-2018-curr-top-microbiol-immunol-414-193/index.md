abstract: Cardiac myocytes are the cells responsible for the robust ability of the
  heart to pump blood throughout the circulatory system. Cardiac myocytes grow in
  response to a variety of physiological and pathological conditions; this growth
  challenges endoplasmic reticulum-protein quality control (ER-PQC), a major feature
  of which includes the unfolded protein response (UPR). ER-PQC and the UPR in cardiac
  myocytes growing under physiological conditions, including normal development, exercise,
  and pregnancy, are sufficient to support hypertrophic growth of each cardiac myocyte.
  However, the ER-PQC and UPR are insufficient to respond to the challenge of cardiac
  myocyte growth under pathological conditions, including myocardial infarction and
  heart failure. In part, this insufficiency is due to a continual decline in the
  expression levels of important adaptive UPR components as a function of age and
  during myocardial pathology. This chapter will discuss the physiological and pathological
  conditions unique to the heart that involves ER-PQC, and whether the UPR is adaptive
  or maladaptive under these circumstances.
