abstract: We have investigated endothelin (ET)-regulated secretion of atrial natriuretic
  factor (ANF) from primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, where hormone release
  is thought to be constitutive. In a dose-dependent, nifedipine-sensitive manner,
  ET acutely enhanced ANF release by two- to fivefold over control cultures within
  15 min of agonist exposure, demonstrating that ventricular myocytes display a primary
  characteristic of a regulated secretory cell type. Unlike atrial cultures, ET enhanced
  ANF release during the first 30 min of exposure; thereafter, secretion rates returned
  to control levels. KCl, however, effectively enhanced ANF release only during the
  first 15 min of exposure. Subcellular fractionation of ventricular culture homogenates
  did not reveal atrial-type dense secretory granules, and pulse-chase labeling experiments
  showed that the transit time of newly synthesized ANF was short in ventricular myocytes
  [time required for half of labeled ANF to be released from cells (t1/2) = 0.5-1.5
  h) compared with atrial myocytes (t1/2 = 4 h). These results suggest that, whereas
  ventricular myocytes possess some of the characteristics of a constitutively secreting
  cell type (e.g., few, if any, dense secretory granules and rapid transit time for
  newly synthesized hormone); however, they also display the capacity for regulated
  secretion of ANF in response to the physiological agonist ET.
