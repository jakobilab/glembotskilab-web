abstract: Pharmacologic activation of stress-responsive signaling pathways provides
  a promising approach for ameliorating imbalances in proteostasis associated with
  diverse diseases. However, this approach has not been employed in vivo. Here we
  show, using a mouse model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, that selective pharmacologic
  activation of the ATF6 arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) during reperfusion,
  a typical clinical intervention point after myocardial infarction, transcriptionally
  reprograms proteostasis, ameliorates damage and preserves heart function. These
  effects were lost upon cardiac myocyte-specific Atf6 deletion in the heart, demonstrating
  the critical role played by ATF6 in mediating pharmacologically activated proteostasis-based
  protection of the heart. Pharmacological activation of ATF6 is also protective in
  renal and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion models, demonstrating its widespread utility.
  Thus, pharmacologic activation of ATF6 represents a proteostasis-based therapeutic
  strategy for ameliorating ischemia/reperfusion damage, underscoring its unique translational
  potential for treating a wide range of pathologies caused by imbalanced proteostasis.
