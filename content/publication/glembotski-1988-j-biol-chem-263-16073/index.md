abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated that primary cultures of cardiac myocytes
  maintained in a complete serum-free medium contain a precursor to atrial natriuretic
  factor (ANF-(1-126]. The cultured cells secrete this precursor unless maintained
  in the presence of glucocorticoids wherein the known circulating form derived from
  the C-terminal of ANF (ANF-(99-126] is secreted. The present study was designed
  to determine the fate of the N-terminal region of the ANF precursor during secretion
  from myocytes maintained in glucocorticoids. A radioimmunoassay (RIA) was developed
  using synthetic ANF-(1-16); the antiserum demonstrated cross-reactivity toward ANF-(1-126)
  and ANF-(1-98)-like peptides but did not cross-react with ANF-(99-126). Coupling
  this RIA with an ANF-(99-126)-specific RIA and reversed phase, size exclusion, and
  ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), it was shown that primary
  cultures of atrial myocytes maintained in dexamethasone contained ANF-(1-126) and
  secreted ANF-(99-126) and a peptide that was chromatographically indistinguishable
  from ANF-(1-98). Isolated perfused rat hearts were also shown by RIA and HPLC to
  secrete similar peptides. The primary cells were labeled with [35S]methionine, and
  the secreted N-terminal ANF-related material was immunoprecipitated with the ANF-(1-16)
  antiserum. HPLC, tryptic peptide mapping, and radiosequencing demonstrated that
  this peptide possessed an N-terminal structure identical to that of ANF-(1-126).
  When the cells were labeled with [3H] leucine and the secreted N-terminal ANF-related
  material was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by tryptic mapping, it was shown to
  possess labeled tryptic peptides consistent with the structure of ANF-(1-98). Tryptic
  mapping of [3H]arginine-labeled N-terminal ANF-related material demonstrated the
  presence of all peptides consistent with the ANF-(1-98) structure, including ANF-(92-98).
  These studies demonstrate that primary atrial myocytes contain ANF-(1-126) and in
  the presence of dexamethasone secrete both ANF-(1-98) and ANF-(99-126), the two
  major circulating forms of the hormone.
