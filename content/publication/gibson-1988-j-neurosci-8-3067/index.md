abstract: Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptors from A10 cultured vascular smooth
  muscle cells (VSMC) and rat olfactory bulbs have been solubilized and then pharmacologically
  and biochemically compared. The dissociation constant for 125I-ANP(99-126) was 12.7
  pM for the VSMC-derived receptor and 164 pM for the olfactory receptor. Competition
  binding between 125I-ANP(99-126) and several unlabeled ANP analogs with the soluble
  olfactory receptor, demonstrated a rank order potency of ANP(99-126) = ANP(103-126)
  much greater than ANP(103-123). However, the rank order potency of the soluble VSMC
  ANP receptor was ANP(99-126) = ANP(103-126) = ANP(103-123). Therefore, the olfactory
  ANP receptor appears to require the complete COOH-terminal sequence of ANP as compared
  with the VSMC ANP receptor. When the 2 soluble receptor preparations were applied
  to a GTP-agarose column, a portion of the olfactory ANP receptor was retained on
  the column and could be eluted with 5 mM GTP, while the VSMC ANP receptor did not
  adsorb to the column. Since the olfactory bulb ANP receptor has been shown to contain
  a binding component of 116 kDa, while the VSMC ANP receptor binding component is
  66 kDa, these receptors appear to be similar to the 2 receptor classes described
  recently in which the 120 kDa receptor that binds GTP is postulated to be coupled
  to guanylate cyclase, while the 60 kDa receptor does not bind GTP, is not coupled
  to guanylate cyclase, and may possess a hormone clearance function. Taken together,
  these data indicate that cyclic GMP appears to be a second messenger for ANP in
  the brain.
