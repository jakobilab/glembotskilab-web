abstract: To study the mechanisms which mediate the transcriptional activation of
  cardiac genes during alpha adrenergic stimulation, the present study examined the
  regulated expression of three cardiac genes, a ventricular embryonic gene (atrial
  natriuretic factor, ANF), a constitutively expressed contractile protein gene (cardiac
  MLC-2), and a cardiac sodium channel gene. alpha 1-Adrenergic stimulation activates
  the expression and release of ANF from neonatal ventricular cells. As assessed by
  RNase protection analyses, treatment with alpha-adrenergic agonists increases the
  steady-state levels of ANF mRNA by greater than 15-fold. However, a rat cardiac
  sodium channel gene mRNA is not induced, indicating that alpha-adrenergic stimulation
  does not lead to an increase in the expression of all cardiac genes. Studies employing
  a series of rat ANF luciferase and rat MLC-2 luciferase fusion genes identify 315-
  and 92-base pair cis regulatory sequences within an embryonic gene (ANF) and a constitutively
  expressed contractile protein gene (MLC-2), respectively, which mediate alpha-adrenergic-inducible
  gene expression. Transfection of various ANF luciferase reporters into neonatal
  rat ventricular cells demonstrated that upstream sequences which mediate tissue-specific
  expression (-3003 to -638) can be segregated from those responsible for inducibility.
  The lack of inducibility of a cardiac Na+ channel gene, and the segregation of ANF
  gene sequences which mediate cardiac specific from those which mediate inducible
  expression, provides further insight into the relationship between muscle-specific
  and inducible expression during cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. Based on these results,
  a testable model is proposed for the induction of embryonic cardiac genes and constitutively
  expressed contractile protein genes and the noninducibility of a subset of cardiac
  genes during alpha-adrenergic stimulation of neonatal rat ventricular cells.
