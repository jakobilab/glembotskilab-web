abstract: The ER stress-inducible transcription factor, x-box binding protein 1 (XBP1),
  which enhances protein glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), was shown
  to also enhance protein glycosylation outside the ER, via a process called O-GlcNAcylation,
  which protected the heart from ischemia/reperfusion damage.
