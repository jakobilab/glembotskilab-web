 abstract = {The ER stress-inducible transcription factor, x-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), which enhances protein glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), was shown to also enhance protein glycosylation outside the ER, via a process called O-GlcNAcylation, which protected the heart from ischemia/reperfusion damage.},
