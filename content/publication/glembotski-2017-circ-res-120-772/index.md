abstract: Recent interest in mechanisms of stem cell-mediated repair in the heart
  have spawned the ``paracrine hypothesis'', which posits that stem cells release
  beneficial substances that improve regeneration and function of the injured and
  diseased myocardium. In support of this hypothesis are findings that small membranous
  vesicles called exosomes are released from stem cells and deliver beneficial cargo
  to cells in the heart. However, in addition to exosomes, which are released by the
  unconventional secretory pathway, are many other factors released by the unconventional
  and the conventional secretory pathways. A broader perspective of mechanisms of
  secretion, as well as an appreciation for the ways in which the secretion of a wide
  range of different types of molecules can be regulated, will spawn new avenues of
  thought necessary to move us beyond the exosome-centric view that drives much of
  the current thinking of the paracrine hypothesis of stem cell-mediated repair in
  the heart.
