abstract: We describe here the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a reactive
  oxygen species (ROS)-activatable prodrug for the selective delivery of 147, a small
  molecule ATF6 activator, for ischemia/reperfusion injury. ROS-activatable prodrug
  1 and a negative control unable to release free drug were synthesized and examined
  for peroxide-mediated activation. Prodrug 1 blocks activity of 147 by its inability
  to undergo metabolic oxidation by ER-resident cytochrome P450 enzymes such as Cyp1A2,
  probed directly here for the first time. Biological evaluation of ROS-activatable
  prodrug 1 in primary cardiomyocytes demonstrates protection against peroxide-mediated
  toxicity and enhances viability following simulated I/R injury. The ability to selectively
  target ATF6 activation under diseased conditions establishes the potential for localized
  stress-responsive signaling pathway activation as a therapeutic approach for I/R
  injury and related protein misfolding maladies.
