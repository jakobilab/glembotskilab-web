abstract: Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is stored within atrial myocyte secretory
  granules as pro-ANF (ANF-(1-126] and is proteolytically processed co-secretionally
  C-terminal to a single basic amino acid to form ANF-(1-98) and the bioactive product
  ANF-(99-126). Pro-ANF is also expressed in certain non-cardiac neuroendocrine cell
  types (e.g. brain, adrenal). Although the relatively low levels of the peptide in
  these cell types have precluded detailed processing and secretion studies using
  cultured cells, some work with tissue extracts suggests that pro-ANF is pre-secretionally
  processed between or C-terminal to Arg101-Arg102 in such cells. In order to assess
  whether cultured non-cardiac endocrine cells process pro-ANF pre- or co-secretionally,
  and to establish whether both paired and single basic amino acids can serve as cleavage
  sites, transfection studies were carried out using the adrenocorticotropic hormone
  (ACTH)-producing pituitary tumor cell line AtT-20/D-16v. These cells normally cleave
  pro-ACTH/endorphin pre-secretionally at selected, but not all, pairs of basic amino
  acids to a variety of product peptides. A prepro-ANF expression plasmid was constructed
  and transfected into the AtT-20 cells. The resulting ANF/AtT-20 cell clone selected
  for this study expressed ACTH at levels similar to the untransfected wild type cells
  and secreted immunoreactive ANF-related material at a rate of approximately 1 fmol/min/10(5)
  cells, which was about 10% the rate of ACTH secretion. The rates of secretion of
  both ANF and ACTH could be increased 3-5-fold with a variety of known AtT-20 cell
  secretagogues including phorbol esters and the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol,
  thus indicating that both peptides were routed through regulated secretory pathways.
  Utilizing a combination of specific antisera directed against various regions of
  pro-ANF, size exclusion and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography,
  and peptide mapping, it was shown that the ANF/AtT-20 cells contained and secreted
  the bioactive peptide ANF-(103-126) and -(1-97). These results indicate that the
  ANF/AtT-20 cells specifically cleave pro-ANF pre-secretionally at the same single
  basic site used by cardiac tissue; this single basic cleavage is apparently followed
  by removal of Arg98 by carboxypeptidase H. It is also apparent that the cells can
  cleave at the sole paired basic site in pro-ANF, which is the probable cleavage
  site used by neurons and some other endocrine cells that express low levels of the
  prohormone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
