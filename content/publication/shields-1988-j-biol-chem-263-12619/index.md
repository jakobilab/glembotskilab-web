abstract: Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is stored in mammalian atria primarily as
  ANF-(1-126), the precursor to the known circulating form of the hormone ANF-(99-126).
  When primary cultures of atrial myocytes were maintained in a complete serum-free
  medium, they contained and secreted an ANF-(1-126)-like peptide. The addition of
  dexamethasone to the culture medium, however, resulted in the secretion of a molecule
  with chromatographic characteristics identical to ANF-(99-126), although the intracellular
  storage form of ANF was unchanged. Radiosequencing and amino acid analysis confirmed
  that the cultures maintained in dexamethasone secreted authentic ANF-(99-126). Chronic
  exposure of the cells to dexamethasone also resulted in a significant increase in
  the quantity of immunoreactive ANF both contained and secreted by the cultures.
  Dexamethasone stimulated ANF processing and secretion by atrial cultures in a dose-dependent
  manner, with an approximate EC50 of 10 nM. This stimulation could be reversed by
  removing the glucocorticoid from the culture medium. ANF processing was also stimulated
  by the specific glucocorticoid receptor agonist RU 28362, and both DEX- and RU 28362-stimulated
  ANF processing was inhibited by the specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist
  RU 38486. Ventricular cells, which possess few granules and release ANF in a constitutive
  fashion, were also capable of processing ANF in a glucocorticoid-dependent fashion.
  Medium freshly removed from atrial cultures did not convert ANF-(1-126) to ANF-(99-126)
  nor was exogenous ANF-(1-126) efficiently processed when added to the medium of
  actively processing cultures. These results indicate that the post-translational
  processing of ANF-(1-126) to ANF-(99-126) likely occurs within or in close association
  with the cardiac myocytes and is not dependent on the presence of large quantities
  of secretory granules. Furthermore, it is apparent that both the expression and
  the post-translational processing of ANF by cultured cardiac myocytes is specifically
  regulated by glucocorticoids.
