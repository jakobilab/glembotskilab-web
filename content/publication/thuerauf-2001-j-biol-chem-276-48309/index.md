abstract: The recently described transcription factor, ATF6, mediates the expression
  of proteins that compensate for potentially stressful changes in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), such as reduced ER calcium. In cardiac myocytes the maintenance
  of optimal calcium levels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a specialized form
  of the ER, is required for proper contractility. The present study investigated
  the hypothesis that ATF6 serves as a regulator of the expression of sarco/endoplasmic
  reticulum calcium ATPase-2 (SERCA2), a protein that transports calcium into the
  SR from the cytoplasm. Depletion of SR calcium in cultured cardiac myocytes fostered
  the translocation of ATF6 from the ER to the nucleus, activated the promoter for
  rat SERCA2, and led to increased levels of SERCA2 protein. SERCA2 promoter induction
  by calcium depletion was partially blocked by dominant-negative ATF6, whereas constitutively
  activated ATF6 led to SERCA2 promoter activation. Mutation analyses identified a
  promoter-proximal ER stress-response element in the rat SERCA2 gene that was required
  for maximal induction by ATF6 and calcium depletion. Although this element was shown
  to be responsible for all of the effects of ATF6 on SERCA2 promoter activation,
  it was responsible for only a portion of the effects of calcium depletion. Thus,
  SERCA2 induction in response to calcium depletion appears to be a potentially physiologically
  important compensatory response to this stress that involves intracellular signaling
  pathways that are both dependent and independent of ATF6.
