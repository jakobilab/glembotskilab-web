abstract: Expression of constitutively active Ras (V12Ras) in cultured neonatal rat
  ventricular myocytes or targeted cardiac expression of V12Ras in transgenic mice
  induces myocardial cell growth and expression of genes that are markers of cardiac
  hypertrophy including atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and myosin light chain-2.
  However, the signaling pathways that modulate the effects of Ras on acquisition
  of the various features of cardiac hypertrophy are not known. We identified the
  Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor-like factor (Rlf) in a yeast two-hybrid screen
  of human heart cDNA library using Ras as bait, suggesting that Ras signaling in
  the heart may involve Rlf. We demonstrate here that Rlf is expressed in human heart.
  Expression of wild type Rlf or Rlf-CAAX, a membrane-targeted mutant of Rlf, transactivated
  ANF and myosin light chain-2 promoters but did not activate canonical cAMP responsive
  elements or phorbol ester responsive elements, suggesting that Rlf expression does
  not lead to a generalized increase in transcription. Transfection of mutant ANF
  promoter-reporter gene constructs demonstrated that the proximal serum response
  element is both necessary and sufficient for Rlf-inducible ANF expression. Rlf-induced
  ANF promoter activation required Ral and Cdc42 but not RhoA, Rac1, ERK, or p38 kinase
  activation. In addition, Rlf potentiated alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(1)-AR)-induced
  ANF expression. Prolonged activation of the alpha(1)-AR increases RalGTP levels
  in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, further emphasizing a role for Ral guanine
  nucleotide exchange factors in alpha(1)-AR signaling. Overall, this study supports
  the concept that Rlf and Ral are important previously unrecognized signaling components
  that regulate transcriptional responses in myocardial cells.
