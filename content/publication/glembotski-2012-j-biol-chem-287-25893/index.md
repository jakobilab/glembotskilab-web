abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress protein mesencephalic astrocyte-derived
  neurotrophic factor (MANF) has been reported to protect cells from stress-induced
  cell death before and after its secretion; however, the conditions under which it
  is secreted are not known. Accordingly, we examined the mechanism of MANF release
  from cultured ventricular myocytes and HeLa cells, both of which secrete proteins
  via the constitutive pathway. Although the secretion of proteins via the constitutive
  pathway is not known to increase upon changes in intracellular calcium, MANF secretion
  was increased within 30 min of treating cells with compounds that deplete sarcoplasmic
  reticulum (SR)/ER calcium. In contrast, secretion of atrial natriuretic factor from
  ventricular myocytes was not increased by SR/ER calcium depletion, suggesting that
  not all secreted proteins exhibit the same characteristics as MANF. We postulated
  that SR/ER calcium depletion triggered MANF secretion by decreasing its retention.
  Consistent with this were co-immunoprecipitation and live cell, zero distance, photo
  affinity cross-linking, demonstrating that, in part, MANF was retained in the SR/ER
  via its calcium-dependent interaction with the SR/ER-resident protein, GRP78 (glucose-regulated
  protein 78 kDa). This unusual mechanism of regulating secretion from the constitutive
  secretory pathway provides a potentially missing link in the mechanism by which
  extracellular MANF protects cells from stresses that deplete SR/ER calcium. Consistent
  with this was our finding that administration of recombinant MANF to mice decreased
  tissue damage in an in vivo model of myocardial infarction, a condition during which
  ER calcium is known to be dysregulated, and MANF expression is induced.
