abstract: To better understand the molecular basis for increased atrial natriuretic
  factor (ANF) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) expression during overload-induced
  cardiac hypertrophy, we studied the induction of the genes in primary myocardial
  cells by the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine (PE), a potent hypertrophic
  agent. PE augmented the transcription of both genes to similar extents, although
  the time course of mRNA accumulation differed. Increases in ANF mRNA were evident
  only after 6-8 h of PE exposure, when transcript levels were 2-4-fold over control.
  However, similar increases in BNP mRNA were observed as soon as 1 h of PE exposure.
  Moreover, while ANF mRNA levels continued to increase through 24 h of PE treatment,
  maximal levels of BNP mRNA (8-10-fold over control) were observed at 4 h, after
  which transcript levels declined to about 3-fold over control. The early induction
  of the BNP mRNA by PE was independent of protein synthesis, whereas the late induction
  of both genes required protein synthesis. Interestingly, the early BNP induction
  was only partially blocked by the transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D, indicating
  that, in part, the inductive effects of PE might be the result of transcript stabilization.
  Indeed, the BNP transcript, which was shown to possess a half-life of less than
  1 h in control cells, was stabilized by the addition of PE, while the ANF transcript
  possessed a half-life of at least 24 h under all conditions. These data indicate
  that the induction of BNP by alpha 1-adrenergic agonists has characteristics of
  both a primary and secondary response gene, while ANF is a typical secondary response
  gene. Moreover, alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation enhances BNP expression through both
  transcriptional activation and transcript stabilization, while ANF expression is
  enhanced primarily transcriptionally.
