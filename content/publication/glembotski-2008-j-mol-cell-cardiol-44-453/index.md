abstract: The misfolding of nascent proteins, or the unfolding of proteins after synthesis
  is complete, can occur in response to numerous environmental stresses, or as a result
  of mutations that de-stabilize protein structure. Cells have developed elaborate
  protein quality control systems that recognize improperly folded proteins and either
  refold them or facilitate their degradation. One such quality control system is
  the unfolded protein response, or the UPR. The UPR is a highly conserved signal
  transduction system that is activated when cells are subjected to conditions that
  alter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in ways that impair the folding of nascent
  proteins in this organelle. Recent observations indicate that in the heart, the
  UPR is activated during acute stresses, including ischemia/reperfusion, as well
  as upon longer term stresses that lead to cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.
  Moreover, certain aspects of the UPR are activated during, and are required for
  proper heart development. This review summarizes recent studies of the UPR in the
  heart, focusing on the possible roles of the UPR in contributing to, or protecting
  from ischemia/reperfusion damage.
