abstract: 'RATIONALE: Cardioprotective signaling mediates antiapoptotic actions through
  multiple mechanisms including maintenance of mitochondrial integrity. Pim-1 kinase
  is an essential downstream effector of AKT-mediated cardioprotection but the mechanistic
  basis for maintenance of mitochondrial integrity by Pim-1 remains unexplored. This
  study details antiapoptotic actions responsible for enhanced cell survival in cardiomyocytes
  with elevated Pim-1 activity. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate
  that the cardioprotective kinase Pim-1 acts to inhibit cell death by preserving
  mitochondrial integrity in cardiomyocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: A combination of
  biochemical, molecular, and microscopic analyses demonstrate beneficial effects
  of Pim-1 on mitochondrial integrity. Pim-1 protein level increases in the mitochondrial
  fraction with a corresponding decrease in the cytosolic fraction of myocardial lysates
  from hearts subjected to 30 minutes of ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion.
  Cardiac-specific overexpression of Pim-1 results in higher levels of antiapoptotic
  Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2 compared to samples from normal hearts. In response to oxidative
  stress challenge, Pim-1 preserves the inner mitochondrial membrane potential. Ultrastructure
  of the mitochondria is maintained by Pim-1 activity, which prevents swelling induced
  by calcium overload. Finally, mitochondria isolated from hearts created with cardiac-specific
  overexpression of Pim-1 show inhibition of cytochrome c release triggered by a truncated
  form of proapoptotic Bid. CONCLUSION: Cardioprotective action of Pim-1 kinase includes
  preservation of mitochondrial integrity during cardiomyopathic challenge conditions,
  thereby raising the potential for Pim-1 kinase activation as a therapeutic interventional
  approach to inhibit cell death by antagonizing proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members
  that regulate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.'
