abstract: Activating transcription factor-6 α (ATF6) is one of the three main sensors
  and effectors of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and, as such, it
  is critical for protecting the heart and other tissues from a variety of environmental
  insults and disease states. In the heart, ATF6 has been shown to protect cardiac
  myocytes. However, its roles in other cell types in the heart are unknown. Here
  we show that ATF6 decreases the activation of cardiac fibroblasts in response to
  the cytokine, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), which can induce fibroblast trans-differentiation
  into a myofibroblast phenotype through signaling via the TGFβ-Smad pathway. ATF6
  activation suppressed fibroblast contraction and the induction of α smooth muscle
  actin (αSMA). Conversely, fibroblasts were hyperactivated when ATF6 was silenced
  or deleted. ATF6 thus represents a novel inhibitor of the TGFβ-Smad axis of cardiac
  fibroblast activation.
