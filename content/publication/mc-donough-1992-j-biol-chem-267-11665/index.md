abstract: While hormonal stimuli and mechanical stretch can induced cardiac-specific
  gene expression and in some cases cellular hypertrophy, the relationship between
  myocyte contraction frequency, gene expression, and myocyte growth has not been
  well characterized. In this study a new model system was developed in which cultures
  of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were subjected to long term pacing of contractions
  with pulsatile electrical stimulation. Myocytes submitted to electrical stimulation
  for 3 days displayed dramatic increases in cellular size and myofibrillar organization,
  and a 5-10-fold increase in the expression of the cardiac genes atrial natriuretic
  factor and myosin light chain-2. Atrial natriuretic factor expression induced by
  electrical stimulation of contractions was inhibited by nifedipine or W7, indicating
  a dependence on calcium influx and calmodulin activity. Phosphoinositide hydrolysis
  and cAMP formation were not affected by electrical stimulation suggesting that gene
  induction occurred independently of the activation of protein kinases C or A above
  basal levels. These findings show that the cellular events associated with contraction,
  such as changes in cytoplasmic free calcium levels and/or cellular stretch, may
  serve as important determinants of myocyte growth and cardiac gene expression.
