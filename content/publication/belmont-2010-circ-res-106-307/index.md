abstract: 'RATIONALE: Stresses, such as ischemia, impair folding of nascent proteins
  in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), activating the unfolded protein response,
  which restores efficient ER protein folding, thus leading to protection from stress.
  In part, the unfolded protein response alleviates ER stress and cell death by increasing
  the degradation of terminally misfolded ER proteins via ER-associated degradation
  (ERAD). ERAD is increased by the ER stress modulator, activating transcription factor
  (ATF)6, which can induce genes that encode components of the ERAD machinery. OBJECTIVE:
  Recently, it was shown that the mouse heart is protected from ischemic damage by
  ATF6; however, ERAD has not been studied in the cardiac context. A recent microarray
  study showed that the Derlin-3 (Derl3) gene, which encodes an important component
  of the ERAD machinery, is robustly induced by ATF6 in the mouse heart. METHODS AND
  RESULTS: In the present study, activated ATF6 induced Derl3 in cultured cardiomyocytes,
  and in the heart, in vivo. Simulated ischemia (sI), which activates ER stress, induced
  Derl3 in cultured myocytes, and in an in vivo mouse model of myocardial infarction,
  Derl3 was also induced. Derl3 overexpression enhanced ERAD and protected cardiomyocytes
  from simulated ischemia-induced cell death, whereas dominant-negative Derl3 decreased
  ERAD and increased simulated ischemia-induced cardiomyocyte death. CONCLUSIONS:
  This study describes a potentially protective role for Derl3 in the heart, and is
  the first to investigate the functional consequences of enhancing ERAD in the cardiac
  context.'
