abstract: Although the function of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER)
  in cardiac contractile calcium handling is well established, its roles in protein
  synthesis, folding, and quality control in cardiac myocytes are not as clear. This
  review explores evidence suggesting that, in cardiac myocytes, protein synthesis
  and contractile calcium handling may be physically and functionally integrated.
