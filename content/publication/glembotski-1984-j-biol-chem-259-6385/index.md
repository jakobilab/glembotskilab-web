abstract: A secretory granule associated enzymatic activity from the rat anterior
  pituitary that can convert the synthetic peptide D-Tyr-Val-Gly into D-Tyr-Val-NH2
  is described. Due to the presence of inhibitory activity in the cytosol and rough
  endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus fractions, the alpha-amidation activity is
  barely detectable in crude rat anterior pituitary homogenates. The alpha-amidation
  activity was primarily soluble, displayed a pH optimum of about 7.0, and showed
  a requirement for molecular oxygen. The activity was stimulated 7-fold by the addition
  of optimal concentrations of copper. Of the cofactors tested, only reduced ascorbate
  produced a severalfold stimulation of activity. Studies with varied D-Tyr-Val-Gly
  or varied monoiodo-D-Tyr-Val-Gly demonstrate Michaelis Menten kinetics with indistinguishable
  kinetic constants for both peptides. Upon addition of ascorbate, the apparent Km
  and Vmax for the synthetic substrate, as estimated from Lineweaver-Burk and Eadie-Hofstee
  plots, increased by 30- and 60-fold, respectively. Several alpha-melanotropin- and
  gamma-melanotropin-related peptides with COOH-terminal glycine residues were effective
  competitive inhibitors of the reaction while the corresponding alpha-amidated peptides
  were very poor inhibitors. The rat anterior pituitary alpha-amidation activity appears
  to be very similar to the alpha-amidation activity in rat intermediate and neural
  pituitary, and mouse anterior pituitary tumor cells.
