abstract: The hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes is a highly dynamic process
  that underlies physiological and pathological adaptation of the heart. Accordingly,
  a better understanding of the molecular underpinnings of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy
  is required in order to fully appreciate the causes and functional consequences
  of the changes in the size of the healthy and diseased heart. Hypertrophy is driven
  by increases in cardiac myocyte protein, which must be balanced by cellular ability
  to maintain protein quality in order to avoid maladaptive accumulation of toxic
  misfolded proteins. Recent studies have shown that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
  which, in cardiac myocytes, comprises the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER), is
  the site of most protein synthesis. Thus, the protein quality control machinery
  located at the SR/ER is likely to be an important determinant of whether the heart
  responds adaptively to hypertrophic growth stimuli. The SR/ER-transmembrane protein,
  ATF6, serves a critical protein quality control function as a first responder to
  the accumulation of potentially toxic, misfolded proteins. Misfolded proteins transform
  ATF6 into a transcription factor that regulates a gene program that is partly responsible
  for enhancing protein quality control. Two ATF6-inducible genes that have been studied
  in the heart and shown to be adaptive are RCAN1 and Derl3, which encode proteins
  that decrease protein-folding demand, and enhance degradation of misfolded proteins,
  respectively. Thus, the ATF6-regulated SR/ER protein quality control system is important
  for maintaining protein quality during growth, making ATF6, and other components
  of the system, potentially attractive targets for the therapeutic management pathological
  cardiac hypertrophy. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \"Protein
  Quality Control, the Ubiquitin Proteasome System, and Autophagy\".
