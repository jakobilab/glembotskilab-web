abstract: Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) affects the integrity of the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER), the site of synthesis and folding of numerous proteins. Therefore, I/R may
  activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), resulting in the induction of a collection
  of ER stress proteins, many of which are protective and function to resolve the
  ER stress. In this study, we showed that when mouse hearts were subjected to ex
  vivo I/R, the levels of 2 ER stress-inducible markers of the UPR, the ER-targeted
  cytoprotective chaperones glucose-regulated proteins 78 and 94 (GRP78 and GRP94),
  were increased, consistent with I/R-mediated UPR activation in the heart. The UPR-mediated
  activation of ATF6 (Activation of Transcription Factor 6) induces cytoprotective
  ER stress proteins, including GRP78 and GRP94. To examine whether ATF6 protects
  the myocardium from I/R injury in the heart, we generated transgenic (TG) mice featuring
  cardiac-restricted expression of a novel tamoxifen-activated form of ATF6, ATF6-MER.
  When NTG and ATF6-MER TG mice were treated with or without tamoxifen for 5 days,
  only the hearts from the tamoxifen-treated TG mice exhibited increased levels of
  many ER stress-inducible mRNAs and proteins; for example, GRP78 and GRP94 transcript
  levels were increased by 8- and 15-fold, respectively. The tamoxifen-treated TG
  mouse hearts also exhibited better functional recovery from ex vivo I/R, as well
  as significantly reduced necrosis and apoptosis. These results suggest that the
  UPR is activated in the heart during I/R and that, as a result, the ATF6 branch
  of the UPR may induce expression of proteins that can function to reduce I/R injury.
