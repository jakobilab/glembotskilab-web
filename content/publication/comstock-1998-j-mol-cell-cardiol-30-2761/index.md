abstract: The bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contributes to the cardiovascular
  collapse and death observed in patients with sepsis. Because LPS has such profound
  effects on cardiac performance, we speculate that direct effects of LPS could be
  demonstrated on cardiomyocytes in culture, and that these direct effects are mediated
  by the LPS receptor, CD14. Accordingly, in this study, we provide evidence for CD14-dependent
  cardiotoxic effects of LPS including the LPS-stimulated secretion of tumor necrosis
  factor alpha (TNF-alpha) from cardiomyocytes. TNF-alpha is an inflammatory cytokine
  which is known for its negative inotropic effects on cardiac performance, but has
  not until recently been shown to be produced by cardiac cells. In this study, LPS
  was found to stimulate strongly in a dose-dependent manner the secretion of TNF-alpha
  from cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes. Further, LPS-induced TNF-alpha secretion
  was blocked by an inhibitor of TNF-alpha processing, metallomatrix protease inhibitor
  (TAPI). Molecular and immunological evidence demonstrated the presence of LPS receptors
  (CD14) on cardiomyocytes. Attenuated TNF-alpha secretion following PI-PLC treatment
  confirmed the functional importance of CD14 for LPS-mediated myocardial effects.
  Importantly, LPS also triggered apoptosis in cultured cardiomyocytes as quantified
  by single-cell gel electrophoresis of nuclei exhibiting DNA fragmentation patterns
  characteristic of apoptosis (i.e. cardiac comets). Apoptotic cell death was blocked
  by pre-incubation with the soluble TNF-alpha receptor fragment (TNFRII:Fc), suggesting
  that LPS-induced apoptosis was TNF-alpha-dependent and probably involved an autocrine
  function for the TNF-alpha whose secretion was under LPS control. The results of
  this study suggest that the cardiodepressant effects of LPS are dependent on CD14
  signaling and may not only be due to acute negative inotropic effects of TNF-alpha
  but also may be complicated by TNF-alpha-induced apoptotic cell death which effectively
  reduces the number of working myocardial cells.
