abstract: 'RATIONALE: Hydroxymethyl glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase degradation protein
  1 (Hrd1) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase that
  has been studied in yeast, where it contributes to ER protein quality control by
  ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins that accumulate during ER
  stress. Neither Hrd1 nor ERAD has been studied in the heart, or in cardiac myocytes,
  where protein quality control is critical for proper heart function. OBJECTIVE:
  The objective of this study were to elucidate roles for Hrd1 in ER stress, ERAD,
  and viability in cultured cardiac myocytes and in the mouse heart, in vivo. METHODS
  AND RESULTS: The effects of small interfering RNA-mediated Hrd1 knockdown were examined
  in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The effects of adeno-associated virus-mediated
  Hrd1 knockdown and overexpression were examined in the hearts of mice subjected
  to pressure overload-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy, which challenges
  protein-folding capacity. In cardiac myocytes, the ER stressors, thapsigargin and
  tunicamycin increased ERAD, as well as adaptive ER stress proteins, and minimally
  affected cell death. However, when Hrd1 was knocked down, thapsigargin and tunicamycin
  dramatically decreased ERAD, while increasing maladaptive ER stress proteins and
  cell death. In vivo, Hrd1 knockdown exacerbated cardiac dysfunction and increased
  apoptosis and cardiac hypertrophy, whereas Hrd1 overexpression preserved cardiac
  function and decreased apoptosis and attenuated cardiac hypertrophy in the hearts
  of mice subjected to pressure overload. CONCLUSIONS: Hrd1 and ERAD are essential
  components of the adaptive ER stress response in cardiac myocytes. Hrd1 contributes
  to preserving heart structure and function in a mouse model of pathological cardiac
  hypertrophy.'
