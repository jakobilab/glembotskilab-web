abstract: In ventricular myocytes, phenylephrine (PE) and endothelin (ET) stimulate
  phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, cell growth, and expression of several genes [e.g.,
  atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)] often associated with cardiac hypertrophy. In this
  study the production of inositol monophosphate (InsP) and diglyceride (DG), both
  products of PI hydrolysis, and ANF were monitored during long-term exposure (up
  to 72 h) to PE or ET. For PE, InsP production increased and continued unabated throughout
  the time course; DG levels also increased and remained elevated, and similar rates
  of ANF production were observed from 24 to 72 h. For ET, the initial InsP and DG
  responses equaled those to PE, but diminished by 24 h. ET-stimulated ANF production
  equaled the PE response at 24 h but subsided by 72 h. Adding PE to cells previously
  desensitized to ET elicited maximal InsP formation, indicating the desensitization
  was ET specific. These data emphasize that while phenylephrine and endothelin have
  similar initial effects on cardiac second messenger production and ANF expression,
  hormonally specific patterns develop over extended periods of exposure.
