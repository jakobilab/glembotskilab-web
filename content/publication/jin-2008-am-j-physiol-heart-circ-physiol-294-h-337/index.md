abstract: The cytosolic small heat shock protein alphaB-crystallin (alphaBC) is a
  molecular chaperone expressed in large quantities in the heart, where it protects
  from stresses such as ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). Upon I/R, p38 MAP kinase activation
  leads to phosphorylation of alphaBC on Ser(59) (P-alphaBC-S59), which increases
  its protective ability. alphaBC confers protection, in part, by interacting with
  and affecting the functions of key components in stressed cells. We investigated
  the hypothesis that protection from I/R damage in the heart by P-alphaBC-S59 can
  be mediated by localization to mitochondria. We found that P-alphaBC-S59 localized
  to mitochondria isolated from untreated mouse hearts and that this localization
  increased more than threefold when the hearts were subjected to ex vivo I/R. Mitochondrial
  P-alphaBC-S59 decreased when hearts were treated with the p38 inhibitor SB-202190.
  Moreover, SB-202190-treated hearts exhibited more tissue damage and less functional
  recovery upon reperfusion than controls. I/R activates mitochondrial permeability
  transition (MPT) pore opening, which increases cell damage. We found that mitochondria
  incubated with a recombinant mutant form of alphaBC that mimics P-alphaBC-S59 exhibited
  decreased calcium-induced MPT pore opening. These results indicate that mitochondria
  may be among the key components in stressed cells with which P-alphaBC-S59 interacts
  and that this localization may protect the myocardium, in part, by modulating MPT
  pore opening and, thus, reducing I/R injury.
