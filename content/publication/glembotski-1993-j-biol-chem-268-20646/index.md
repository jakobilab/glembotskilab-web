abstract: The protease, alpha-thrombin (alpha Th), affects myocardial cell contractility,
  a feature common among agents that induce hypertrophy. However, it is not known
  whether cardiac myocytes possess alpha Th receptors (alpha Th-R), or if long term
  treatment with alpha Th can enhance growth and gene expression. In the present study
  primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes expressed a 3.6-kilobase mRNA species
  that hybridized with a rat alpha Th-R-specific probe. After 48 h, alpha Th induced
  hypertrophy, sarcomeric organization, and enhanced atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)
  expression, all of which were blocked by the alpha Th-selective protease inhibitor,
  D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone. The alpha Th-R agonist peptide, SFLLRNPND, was
  a potent activator of ANF expression, however, the non-agonist, FLLRNPND, was inactive.
  Transfection experiments showed the enhancement of ANF expression by alpha Th to
  be transcriptional. The abilities of alpha Th to induce myocyte hypertrophy and
  to augment ANF transcription and peptide production were inhibited by the protein
  kinase C inhibitor, chelerythrine, and by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin.
  Thus, myocardial cell alpha Th-Rs are stimulated by the specific proteolytic actions
  of alpha Th, and pathways involving both protein kinase C and protein tyrosine kinases
  are required for subsequent hypertrophy and ANF expression. Further, these findings
  suggest a new role for extracellular proteases as regulators of myocardial cell
  gene expression and growth.
