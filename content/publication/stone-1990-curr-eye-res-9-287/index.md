abstract: Acid extracts of guinea pig and rhesus monkey anterior uvea, choroid and
  retina contain immunoreactive VIP. By reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography,
  the immunoreactive material from these ocular tissues elutes at a position similar
  to synthetic porcine VIP. Only in the guinea pig anterior uvea is a second smaller
  peak detected. By size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography, the peptide
  in the monkey anterior uvea, choroid and retina elutes in the identical position
  as the synthetic porcine VIP standard with an apparent molecular weight of 3450
  daltons. We conclude that a single form of VIP, chromatographically similar to the
  porcine standard, is the predominant form of the peptide in the eye of guinea pig
  and rhesus monkey.
