abstract: A nodal regulator of endoplasmic reticulum stress is the transcription factor,
  ATF6, which is activated by ischemia and protects the heart from ischemic damage,
  in vivo. To explore mechanisms of ATF6-mediated protection in the heart, a whole-genome
  microRNA (miRNA) array analysis of RNA from the hearts of ATF6 transgenic (TG) mice
  was performed. The array identified 13 ATF6-regulated miRNAs, eight of which were
  downregulated, suggesting that they could contribute to increasing levels of their
  mRNAs. The down-regulated miRNAs, including miR-455, were predicted to target 45
  mRNAs that we had previously shown by microarray analysis to be up-regulated by
  ATF6 in the heart. One of the miR-455 targets was calreticulin (Calr), which is
  up-regulated in the pathologic heart, where it modulates hypertrophic growth, potentially
  reducing the impact of the pathology. To validate the effects of miR-455, we showed
  that Calr protein was increased by ATF6 in mouse hearts, in vivo. In cultured cardiac
  myocytes, treatment with the ER stressor, tunicamycin, or with adenovirus encoding
  activated ATF6 decreased miR-455 and increased Calr levels, consistent with the
  effects of ATF6 on miR-455 and Calr, in vivo. Moreover, transfection of cultured
  cardiac myocytes with a synthetic precursor, premiR-455, decreased Calr levels,
  while transfection with an antisense, antimiR-455, increased Calr levels. The results
  of this study suggest that ER stress can regulate gene expression via ATF6-mediated
  changes in micro-RNA levels. Moreover, these findings support the hypothesis that
  ATF6-mediated down-regulation of miR-455 augments Calr expression, which may contribute
  to the protective effects of ATF6 in the heart.
