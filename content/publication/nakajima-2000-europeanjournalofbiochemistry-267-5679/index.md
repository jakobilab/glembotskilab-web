abstract: Recent evidence indicates that sphingolipids are produced by the heart during
  hypoxic stress and by blood platelets during thrombus formation. It is therefore
  possible that sphingolipids may influence heart cell function by interacting with
  G-protein-coupled receptors of the Edg family. In the present study, it was found
  that sphingosine 1-phosphate (Sph1P), the prototypical ligand for Edg receptors,
  produced calcium overload in rat cardiomyocytes. The cDNA for Edg-1 was cloned from
  rat cardiomyocytes and, when transfected in an antisense orientation, effectively
  blocked Edg-1 protein expression and reduced the Sph1P-mediated calcium deregulation.
  Taken together, these results demonstrate that cardiomyocytes express an extracellular
  lipid-sensitive receptorsystem that can respond to sphingolipid mediators. Because
  the major source of Sph1P is from blood platelets, we speculate that Edg-mediated
  Sph1P negative inotropic and cardiotoxic effects may play important roles in acute
  myocardial ischemia where Sph1P levels are probably elevated in response to thrombus.
