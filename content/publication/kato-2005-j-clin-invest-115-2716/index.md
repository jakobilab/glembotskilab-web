abstract: 'This study delineates a mechanism for antiapoptotic signaling initiated
  by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) stimulation leading to elevation of cGMP levels
  and subsequent nuclear accumulation of Akt kinase associated with zyxin, a cytoskeletal
  LIM-domain protein. Nuclear targeting of zyxin induces resistance to cell death
  coincident with nuclear accumulation of activated Akt. Nuclear translocation of
  zyxin triggered by cGMP also promotes nuclear Akt accumulation. Additional supportive
  evidence for nuclear accumulation of zyxin-enhancing cardiomyocyte survival includes
  the following: (a) promotion of zyxin nuclear localization by cardioprotective stimuli;
  (b) zyxin association with phospho-Akt473 induced by cardioprotective stimuli; and
  (c) recruitment of zyxin to the nucleus by activated nuclear-targeted Akt as well
  as recruitment of Akt by nuclear-targeted zyxin. Nuclear accumulation of zyxin requires
  both Akt activation and nuclear localization. Potentiation of cell survival is sensitive
  to stimulation intensity with high-level induction by ANP or cGMP signaling leading
  to apoptotic cell death rather than enhancing resistance to apoptotic stimuli. Myocardial
  nuclear accumulation of zyxin and Akt responds similarly in vivo following treatment
  of mice with ANP or cGMP. Thus, zyxin and activated Akt participate in a cGMP-dependent
  signaling cascade leading from ANP receptors to nuclear accumulation of both molecules.
  Nuclear accumulation of zyxin and activated Akt may represent a fundamental mechanism
  that facilitates nuclear-signal transduction and potentiates cell survival.'
