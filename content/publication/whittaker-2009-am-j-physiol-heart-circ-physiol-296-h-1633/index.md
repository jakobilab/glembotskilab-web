abstract: alphaB-crystallin (alphaBC) is a small heat shock protein expressed at high
  levels in the myocardium where it protects from ischemia-reperfusion damage. Ischemia-reperfusion
  activates p38 MAP kinase, leading to the phosphorylation of alphaBC on serine 59
  (P-alphaBC-S59), enhancing its ability to protect myocardial cells from damage.
  In the heart, ischemia-reperfusion also causes the translocation of alphaBC from
  the cytosol to other cellular locations, one of which was recently shown to be mitochondria.
  However, it is not known whether alphaBC translocates to mitochondria during ischemia-reperfusion,
  nor is it known whether alphaBC phosphorylation takes place before or after translocation.
  In the present study, analyses of mitochondrial fractions isolated from mouse hearts
  subjected to various times of ex vivo ischemia-reperfusion showed that alphaBC translocation
  to mitochondria was maximal after 20 min of ischemia and then declined steadily
  during reperfusion. Phosphorylation of mitochondrial alphaBC was maximal after 30
  min of ischemia, suggesting that at least in part it occurred after alphaBC association
  with mitochondria. Consistent with this was the finding that translocation of activated
  p38 to mitochondria was maximal after only 10 min of ischemia. The overexpression
  of alphaBC-AAE, which mimics alphaBC phosphorylated on serine 59, has been shown
  to stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential and to inhibit apoptosis. In the present
  study, infection of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes with adenovirus-encoded alphaBC-AAE
  decreased peroxide-induced mitochondrial cytochrome c release. These results suggest
  that during ischemia alphaBC translocates to mitochondria, where it is phosphorylated
  and contributes to modulating mitochondrial damage upon reperfusion.
