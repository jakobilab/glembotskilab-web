abstract: Escherichia coli strain CR341T28 will not grow at temperatures above 34
  degrees C in liquid medium, and the adenylate kinase of this strain is heat sensitive.
  When a culture was shifted from a permissive (30 degrees C) to a nonpermissive (36
  degrees C) temperature, the adenylate energy charge fell from 0.9 to 0.2, with a
  concurrent decrease in the number of viable cells and in the specific activity of
  adenylate kinase. When cultures of the temperature-sensitive strain were grown at
  temperatures above 30 degrees C, the adenylate energy charge, the specific activity
  of adenylate kinase, and the growth rate were lower than the corresponding parameters
  for the parental strain. By isotopic labeling of the adenine nucleotides in vivo,
  it was determined that increasing growth temperatures between 30 and 34 degrees
  C for the heat-sensitive strain resulted in a decrease in the adenosine triphosphate-to-adenosine
  monophosphate and adenosine triphosphate-to-adenosine diphosphate ratios. Between
  26 and 30 degrees C the adenosine triphosphate-to-adenosine diphosphate ratio was
  essentially normal in the temperature-sensitive strain, but the adenosine triphosphate-to-adenosine
  diphosphate ratio was decreased. The adenylate ratios in the parental strain did
  not change between 30 and 34 degrees C. The adenylate kinase mass action ratio for
  each strain was essentially constant under all growth conditions. When assayed at
  30 degrees C, the affinities of the enzyme from the mutant strain were somewhat
  lower than those of the parent adenylate kinase. The mutant enzyme also did not
  exhibit the substrate inhibition that was observed at high adenosine monophosphate
  concentrations with the parental enzyme. An increase in the assay temperature from
  30 degrees to 40 degrees C had little or no effect on the Km values determined for
  the parental adenylate kinase, but caused the Km values determined for the mutant
  adenylate kinase to increase by a factor of two or more.
