abstract: Over the last decade, it has become clear that the accumulation of misfolded
  proteins contributes to a number of neurodegenerative, immune, and endocrine pathologies,
  as well as other age-related illnesses. Recent interest has focused on the possibility
  that the accumulation of misfolded proteins can also contribute to vascular and
  cardiac diseases. In large part, the misfolding of proteins takes place during synthesis
  on free ribosomes in the cytoplasm or on endoplasmic reticulum ribosomes. In fact,
  even under optimal conditions, approximately 30% of all newly synthesized proteins
  are rapidly degraded, most likely because of improper folding. Accordingly, stresses
  that perturb the folding of proteins during or soon after synthesis can lead to
  the accumulation of misfolded proteins and to potential cellular dysfunction and
  pathological consequences. To avert such outcomes, cells have developed elaborate
  protein quality-control systems for detecting misfolded proteins and making appropriate
  adjustments to the machinery responsible for protein synthesis and/or degradation.
  Important contributors to protein quality control include cytosolic and organelle-targeted
  molecular chaperones, which help fold and stabilize proteins from unfolding, and
  the ubiquitin proteasome system, which degrades terminally misfolded proteins. Both
  of these systems play important roles in cardiovascular biology. The focus of this
  review is the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, a protein quality-control and
  signal-transduction system that has not been well studied in the context of cardiovascular
  biology but that could be important for vascular and cardiac health and disease.
