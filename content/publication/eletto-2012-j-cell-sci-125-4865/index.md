abstract: ER stress leads to upregulation of multiple folding and quality control
  components, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Glucose Regulated Protein
  78 (GRP78) (also known as binding immunoglobulin protein, BiP, and HSPA5) and GRP94
  are often upregulated coordinately as part of this homeostatic response. Given that
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones have distinct sets of clients, we asked how
  cells respond to ablation of individual chaperones. The cellular responses to silencing
  BiP, GRP94, HSP47, PDIA6 and OS-9, were distinct. When BiP was silenced, a widespread
  UPR was observed, but when GRP94 was either inhibited or depleted by RNA interference
  (RNAi), the expression of only some genes was induced, notably those encoding BiP
  and protein disulfide isomerase A6 (PDIA6). Silencing of HSP47 or OS-9 did not lead
  to any compensatory induction of other genes. The selective response to GRP94 depletion
  was distinct from a typical ER stress response, both because other UPR target genes
  were not affected and because the canonical UPR signaling branches were not activated.
  The response to silencing of GRP94 did not preclude further UPR induction when chemical
  stress was imposed. Importantly, re-expression of wild-type GRP94 in the silenced
  cells prevented the upregulation of BiP and PDIA6, whereas re-expression of an ATPase-deficient
  GRP94 mutant did not, indicating that cells monitor the activity state of GRP94.
  These findings suggest that cells are able to distinguish among folding resources
  and generate distinct responses.
