abstract: Sphingosylphosphocholine (SPC) modulates Ca2+ release from isolated cardiac
  sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes; 50 microM SPC induces the release of 70 80% of
  the accumulated calcium. SPC release calcium from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum
  through the ryanodine receptor, since the release is inhibited by the ryanodine
  receptor channel antagonists ryanodine. Ruthenium Red and sphingosine. In intact
  cardiac myocytes, even in the absence of extracellular calcium. SPC causes a rise
  in diastolic Ca2+, which is greatly reduced when the sarcoplasmic reticulum is depleted
  of Ca2+ by prior thapsigargin treatment. SPC action on the ryanodine receptor is
  Ca(2+)-dependent. SPC shifts to the left the Ca(2+)-dependence of [3H]ryanodine
  binding, but only at high pCa values, suggesting that SPC might increase the sensitivity
  to calcium of the Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)-release mechanism. At high calcium concentrations
  (pCa 4.0 or lower), where [3H]ryanodine binding is maximally stimulated, no effect
  of SPC is observed. We conclude that SPC releases calcium from cardiac sarcoplasmic
  reticulum membranes by activating the ryanodine receptor and possibly another intracellular
  Ca(2+)-release channel, the sphingolipid Ca(2+)-release-mediating protein of endoplasmic
  reticulum (SCaMPER) [Mao, Kim, Almenoff, Rudner, Kearney and Kindman (1996) Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.
  U.S.A 93, 1993-1996], which we have identified for the first time in cardiac tissue.
