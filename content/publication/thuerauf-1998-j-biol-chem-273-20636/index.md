abstract: In various cell types certain stresses can stimulate p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (p38 MAPK), leading to the transcriptional activation of genes that
  contribute to appropriate compensatory responses. In this report the mechanism of
  p38-activated transcription was studied in cardiac myocytes where this MAPK is a
  key regulator of the cell growth and the cardiac-specific gene induction that occurs
  in response to potentially stressful stimuli. In the cardiac atrial natriuretic
  factor (ANF) gene, a promoter-proximal serum response element (SRE), which binds
  serum response factor (SRF), was shown to be critical for ANF induction in primary
  cardiac myocytes transfected with the selective p38 MAPK activator, MKK6 (Glu).
  This ANF SRE does not possess sequences typically required for the binding of the
  Ets-related ternary complex factors (TCFs), such as Elk-1, indicating that p38-mediated
  induction through this element may take place independently of such TCFs. Although
  p38 did not phosphorylate SRF in vitro, it efficiently phosphorylated ATF6, a newly
  discovered SRF-binding protein that is believed to serve as a co-activator of SRF-inducible
  transcription at SREs. Expression of an ATF6 antisense RNA blocked p38-mediated
  ANF induction through the ANF SRE. Moreover, when fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding
  domain, an N-terminal 273-amino acid fragment of ATF6 was sufficient to support
  trans-activation of Gal4/luciferase expression in response to p38 but not the other
  stress kinase, N-terminal Jun kinase (JNK); p38-activating cardiac growth promoters
  also stimulated ATF6 trans-activation. These results indicate that through ATF6,
  p38 can augment SRE-mediated transcription independently of Ets-related TCFs, representing
  a novel mechanism of SRF-dependent transcription by MAP kinases.
