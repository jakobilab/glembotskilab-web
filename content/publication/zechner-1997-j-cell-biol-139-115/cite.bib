 abstract = {Three hallmark features of the cardiac hypertrophic growth program are increases in cell size, sarcomeric organization, and the induction of certain cardiac-specific genes. All three features of hypertrophy are induced in cultured myocardial cells by alpha1- adrenergic receptor agonists, such as phenylephrine (PE) and other growth factors that activate mitogen- activated protein kinases (MAPKs). In this study the MAPK family members extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 were activated by transfecting cultured cardiac myocytes with constructs encoding the appropriate kinases possessing gain-of-function mutations. Transfected cells were then analyzed for changes in cell size, sarcomeric organization, and induction of the genes for the A- and B-type natriuretic peptides (NPs), as well as the alpha-skeletal actin (alpha-SkA) gene. While activation of JNK and/or ERK with MEKK1COOH or Raf-1 BXB, respectively, augmented cell size and effected relatively modest increases in NP and alpha-SkA promoter activities, neither upstream kinase conferred sarcomeric organization. However, transfection with MKK6 (Glu), which specifically activated p38, augmented cell size, induced NP and alpha-Ska promoter activities by up to 130-fold, and elicited sarcomeric organization in a manner similar to PE. Moreover, all three growth features induced by MKK6 (Glu) or PE were blocked with the p38-specific inhibitor, SB 203580. These results demonstrate novel and potentially central roles for MKK6 and p38 in the regulation of myocardial cell hypertrophy.},
