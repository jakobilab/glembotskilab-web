abstract: Three hallmark features of the cardiac hypertrophic growth program are increases
  in cell size, sarcomeric organization, and the induction of certain cardiac-specific
  genes. All three features of hypertrophy are induced in cultured myocardial cells
  by alpha1- adrenergic receptor agonists, such as phenylephrine (PE) and other growth
  factors that activate mitogen- activated protein kinases (MAPKs). In this study
  the MAPK family members extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun NH2-terminal
  kinase (JNK), and p38 were activated by transfecting cultured cardiac myocytes with
  constructs encoding the appropriate kinases possessing gain-of-function mutations.
  Transfected cells were then analyzed for changes in cell size, sarcomeric organization,
  and induction of the genes for the A- and B-type natriuretic peptides (NPs), as
  well as the alpha-skeletal actin (alpha-SkA) gene. While activation of JNK and/or
  ERK with MEKK1COOH or Raf-1 BXB, respectively, augmented cell size and effected
  relatively modest increases in NP and alpha-SkA promoter activities, neither upstream
  kinase conferred sarcomeric organization. However, transfection with MKK6 (Glu),
  which specifically activated p38, augmented cell size, induced NP and alpha-Ska
  promoter activities by up to 130-fold, and elicited sarcomeric organization in a
  manner similar to PE. Moreover, all three growth features induced by MKK6 (Glu)
  or PE were blocked with the p38-specific inhibitor, SB 203580. These results demonstrate
  novel and potentially central roles for MKK6 and p38 in the regulation of myocardial
  cell hypertrophy.
