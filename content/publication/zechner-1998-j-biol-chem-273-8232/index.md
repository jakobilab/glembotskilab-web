abstract: In cardiac myocytes the stimulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
  activates a hypertrophic growth program and the induction of the cardiac-specific
  genes associated with this program. This study focused on determining whether these
  novel growth-promoting effects are accompanied by the p38-mediated inhibition of
  apoptosis, and if so, what signaling pathways might be responsible. Primary neonatal
  rat ventricular myocytes were driven into apoptosis by treatments known to induce
  apoptosis in other cell types, e.g. incubation with anisomycin or overexpression
  constitutively active MEKK-1 (MEKK-1COOH), a protein that strongly activates extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase and N-terminal c-Jun kinase, but not p38. Overexpression
  of constitutively active MKK6, MKK6 (Glu), which selectively activates p38 in cardiac
  myocytes, protected cells from either anisomycin- or MEKK-1COOH-induced apoptosis.
  This protection was blocked by SB 203580, a selective p38 inhibitor. MKK6 (Glu)
  also activated transcription mediated by NF-kappaB, a factor which protects other
  cell types from apoptosis. The activation of NF-kappaB and the protection from apoptosis
  mediated by MKK6 (Glu) were both blocked by SB 203580. Interestingly, overexpression
  of a mutant form of I-kappaBalpha, which inhibits nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB,
  completely blocked MKK6 (Glu)-activated NF-kappaB but had little effect on MKK6s
  anti-apoptotic effects. These findings suggest that, in part, the overexpression
  of MKK6 (Glu) may foster growth and survival of cardiac myocytes by protecting them
  from apoptosis in a p38-dependent manner. Additionally, while NF-kappaB is activated
  in myocardial cells by p38, this does not appear to be the major mechanism by which
  MKK6 (Glu) exerts its anti-apoptotic effects in this cell type, suggesting a novel
  pathway for p38-mediated protection from apoptosis.
