abstract: Proper folding of secreted and transmembrane proteins made in the rough
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) requires oxygen for disulfide bond formation. Accordingly,
  ischemia can impair ER protein folding and initiate the ER stress response, which
  we previously showed is activated in the ischemic heart and in culture cardiac myocytes
  subjected to simulated ischemia. ER stress and ischemia activate the transcription
  factor, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), which induces numerous genes,
  many of which have not been identified, or examined in the heart. Using an ATF6
  transgenic mouse model, we previously showed that ATF6 protected the heart from
  ischemic damage; however, the mechanism of this protection remains to be determined.
  In this study, we showed that, in the mouse heart, and in cultured cardiac myocytes,
  ATF6 induced the protein disulfide isomerase associated 6 (PDIA6) gene, which encodes
  an ER enzyme that catalyzes protein disulfide bond formation. Moreover, in cultured
  cardiac myocytes, ER stress-mediated PDIA6 promoter activation was ATF6-dependent,
  and required an ER stress response element (ERSE) and a nearby CCAAT box element.
  Electromobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that ATF6
  bound to the ERSE in the PDIA6 promoter, in vitro, and in the mouse heart, in vivo.
  Gain- and loss-of-function studies showed that PDIA6 protected cardiac myocytes
  against simulated ischemia/reperfusion-induced death in a manner that was dependent
  on the catalytic activity of PDIA6. Thus, by facilitating disulfide bond formation,
  and enhanced ER protein folding, PDIA6 may contribute to the protective effects
  of ATF6 in the ischemic mouse heart.
