abstract: Atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP) have recently been identified in both
  heart and CNS. These peptides possess potent natriuretic, diuretic, and vasorelaxant
  activities, and are all apparently derived from a single prohormone. Specific ANP
  binding sites have been characterized in the adrenal zona glomerulosa and kidney
  cortex, and one study reported ANP binding sites in the CNS. However, a detailed
  examination of the localization of ANP binding sites throughout the brain has not
  been reported. In this study, quantitative autoradiography was employed to examine
  the distribution of ANP receptors in the rat CNS. The binding of (3-125I-iodotyrosyl28)
  rat ANP-28 to binding sites in the rat CNS was saturable, specific for ANP-related
  peptides, and displayed high affinity (Kd = 600 pM). When the relative concentrations
  of ANP binding sites were determined throughout the rat brain, the highest levels
  of ANP binding were localized to the circumventricular organs, including the area
  postrema and subfornical organ, and the olfactory apparatus. Moderate levels of
  ANP binding sites were present throughout the midbrain and brain stem, while low
  levels were found in the forebrain, diencephalon, basal ganglia, cortex, and cerebellum.
  The presence of ANP binding sites in the subfornical organ and the area postrema,
  regions considered to be outside the blood-brain barrier, suggests that peripheral
  ANP levels may regulate some aspects of CNS control of salt and water balance. The
  possible functions of ANP binding sites in other regions of the rat brain are not
  known, but, like many other peptides, ANP may act as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator
  at these loci.
