abstract: The low-molecular-weight GTP-binding protein RhoA mediates hypertrophic
  growth and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene expression in neonatal rat ventricular
  myocytes. Neither the effector nor the promoter elements through which Rho exerts
  its regulatory effects on ANF gene expression have been elucidated. When constitutively
  activated forms of Rho kinase and two protein kinase C-related kinases, PKN (PRK1)
  and PRK2, were compared, only PKN generated a robust stimulation of a luciferase
  reporter gene driven by a 638-bp fragment on the ANF promoter. This ANF promoter
  fragment contains a proximal serum response element (SRE) and an Sp-1-like element
  required for the transcriptional response to phenylephrine (PE). This response was
  inhibited by dominant negative Rho. The ability of dominant negative Rho to inhibit
  the response to PE and the ability of PKN to stimulate ANF reporter gene expression
  were both lost when the SRE was mutated. Mutation of the Sp-1-like element also
  attenuated the response to PKN. A minimal promoter driven by ANF SRE sequences was
  sufficient to confer Rho- and PKN-mediated gene expression. Interestingly, PKN preferentially
  stimulated the ANF versus the c-fos SRE reporter gene. Thus PKN and Rho are able
  to regulate transcriptional activation of the ANF SRE by a common element that could
  implicate PKN as a downstream effector of Rho in transcriptional responses associated
  with hypertrophy.
