abstract: We define cardiomyokines as heart-derived secreted proteins that affect
  cardiovascular function via autocrine, paracrine and/or endocrine mechanisms. The
  subject of this review is the cardiomyokine, mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic
  factor (MANF). The expression of MANF is increased in the ischemic heart, in part,
  through activation of ER stress, a condition that drastically impairs the expression
  and secretion of most cardiomyokines. This novel function of MANF suggests that
  it may have important roles in the ER stressed, ischemic heart. Consistent with
  this are recent findings showing that MANF protects against ischemic damage, and
  that it is anti-hypertrophic. Accordingly, in light of its function as a potentially
  secreted cardiomyokine, MANF has translational potential as a novel therapy for
  ischemic heart disease. This article is part of a special issue entitled \"Key Signaling
  Molecules in Hypertrophy and Heart Failure.\"
