 abstract = {We define cardiomyokines as heart-derived secreted proteins that affect cardiovascular function via autocrine, paracrine and/or endocrine mechanisms. The subject of this review is the cardiomyokine, mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF). The expression of MANF is increased in the ischemic heart, in part, through activation of ER stress, a condition that drastically impairs the expression and secretion of most cardiomyokines. This novel function of MANF suggests that it may have important roles in the ER stressed, ischemic heart. Consistent with this are recent findings showing that MANF protects against ischemic damage, and that it is anti-hypertrophic. Accordingly, in light of its function as a potentially secreted cardiomyokine, MANF has translational potential as a novel therapy for ischemic heart disease. This article is part of a special issue entitled "Key Signaling Molecules in Hypertrophy and Heart Failure."},
