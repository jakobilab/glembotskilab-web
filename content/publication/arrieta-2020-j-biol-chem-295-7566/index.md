abstract: We have previously demonstrated that ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) impairs
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-based protein folding in the heart and thereby activates
  an unfolded protein response sensor and effector, activated transcription factor
  6Î± (ATF6). ATF6 then induces mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor
  (MANF), an ER-resident protein with no known structural homologs and unclear ER
  function. To determine MANF's function in the heart in vivo, here we developed a
  cardiomyocyte-specific MANF-knockdown mouse model. MANF knockdown increased cardiac
  damage after I/R, which was reversed by AAV9-mediated ectopic MANF expression. Mechanistically,
  MANF knockdown in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) impaired protein
  folding in the ER and cardiomyocyte viability during simulated I/R. However, this
  was not due to MANF-mediated protection from reactive oxygen species generated during
  reperfusion. Because I/R impairs oxygen-dependent ER protein disulfide formation
  and such impairment can be caused by reductive stress in the ER, we examined the
  effects of the reductive ER stressor DTT. MANF knockdown in NRVMs increased cell
  death from DTT-mediated reductive ER stress, but not from nonreductive ER stresses
  caused by thapsigargin-mediated ER Ca(2+) depletion or tunicamycin-mediated inhibition
  of ER protein glycosylation. In vitro, recombinant MANF exhibited chaperone activity
  that depended on its conserved cysteine residues. Moreover, in cells, MANF bound
  to a model ER protein exhibiting improper disulfide bond formation during reductive
  ER stress but did not bind to this protein during nonreductive ER stress. We conclude
  that MANF is an ER chaperone that enhances protein folding and myocyte viability
  during reductive ER stress.
