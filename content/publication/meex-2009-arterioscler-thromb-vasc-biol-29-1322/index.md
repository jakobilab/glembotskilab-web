abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is a sensor of the
  endoplasmic reticulum stress response and regulates expression of several key lipogenic
  genes. We used a 2-stage design to investigate whether ATF6 polymorphisms are associated
  with lipids in subjects at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS
  AND RESULTS: In stage 1, 13 tag-SNPs were tested for association in Dutch samples
  ascertained for familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) or increased risk for CVD
  (CVR). In stage 2, we further investigated the SNP with the strongest association
  from stage 1, a Methionine/Valine substitution at amino-acid 67, in Finnish FCHL
  families and in subjects with CVR from METSIM, a Finnish population-based cohort.
  The combined analysis of both stages reached region-wide significance (P=9 x 10(-4)),
  but this association was not seen in the entire METSIM cohort. Our functional analysis
  demonstrated that Valine at position 67 augments ATF6 protein and its targets Grp78
  and Grp94 as well as increases luciferase expression through Grp78 promoter. CONCLUSIONS:
  A common nonsynonymous variant in ATF6 increases ATF6 protein levels and is associated
  with cholesterol levels in subjects at increased risk for CVD, but this association
  was not seen in a population-based cohort. Further replication is needed to confirm
  the role of this variant in lipids.'
