abstract: The subcellular site of the further processing (NH2-terminal acetylation
  and COOH-terminal proteolysis) of beta-endorphin-sized molecules in the rat intermediate
  pituitary has been studied. Rat intermediate pituitary primary cultures that had
  been incubated in radioactively labeled amino acids were homogenized and the secretory
  granule fraction was separated from the rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus
  fraction. The labeled beta-endorphin-sized molecules in each subcellular fraction
  were analyzed by immunoprecipitation, gel filtration chromatography, and ion exchange
  chromatography. A large percentage of the labeled beta-endorphin-sized molecules
  became NH2 terminally acetylated after becoming associated with the secretory granule
  fraction; most of the further COOH-terminal proteolytic processing of alpha-N-acetyl-beta-endorphin(1-31)
  to form alpha-N-acetyl-beta-endorphin(1-27) and alpha-N-acetyl-beta-endorphin(1-26)
  also occurred when the labeled beta-endorphin-sized molecules were associated with
  the secretory granule fraction. The acetylation of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating
  hormone (alpha MSH)-sized molecules was also investigated in rat intermediate pituitary
  primary cell cultures by immunoprecipitation, gel filtration chromatography, and
  reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Pulse-chase labeling experiments
  showed that newly synthesized molecules co-migrating with adrenocorticotropic hormone
  ((ACTH)(1-13)NH2) were converted first to molecules similar to alpha MSH (alpha-N-acetyl-ACTH(1-13)NH2)
  and then to molecules similar to alpha-N,O-diacetyl-alpha MSH. These results demonstrate
  that the enzyme activity(s) responsible for the NH2-terminal acetylation of beta-endorphin
  alpha MSH-sized molecules is located in the secretory granules of the rat intermediate
  pituitary.
