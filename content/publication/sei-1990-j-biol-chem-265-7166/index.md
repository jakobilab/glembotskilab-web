abstract: Since calcium is involved in both excitation-secretion and excitation-contraction
  coupling, it was of interest to evaluate its involvement in atrial natriuretic factor
  (ANF) release from atrial cardiocytes. In medium containing physiological levels
  of calcium (1.4 mM), the secretion of ANF from primary atrial cells was stimulated
  from 3- to 6-fold by a variety of agents including KCl, phenylephrine, and endothelium
  (ET). However, in medium containing 2 nM calcium, KCl was incapable of increasing
  ANF secretion above basal levels, while the stimulatory effects of phenylephrine
  and ET were only partially diminished. Nifedipine or verapamil could mimic the effects
  of the 2 nM calcium medium on KCl-, phenylephrine-, and ET-stimulated ANF secretion.
  Kinetic studies indicated that during the initial 5 min of ET-stimulated secretion
  the cells exhibited little requirement for extracellular calcium; however, the requirement
  was more apparent during the sustained secretion observed between 10 min and 2 h
  of secretagogue exposure. Additionally, the stimulation of ANF secretion by ET increased
  to a maximum of about 15-fold over basal by 10-min after ET application; subsequent
  to this time there was an apparent functional desensitization wherein the rate of
  secretion decreased by approximately 3-4-fold and remained at this level for the
  duration of secretagogue exposure up to 2 h. All forms of stimulated secretion could
  be inhibited through ionomycin-mediated depletion of intracellular calcium pools.
  Taken together, these results indicate that atrial cardiocytes require both extracellular
  and intracellular calcium to support maximal rates of stimulated ANF secretion,
  and that intracellular calcium pools may be used during the early phase of secretion,
  while the extracellular source of calcium may be important for the sustained phase
  of secretion.
