abstract: The production of alpha-melanotropin (alpha-N-acetyl-ACTH(1-13)NH2 (alpha
  MSH) in rat intermediate pituitary was investigated using reverse phase high performance
  liquid chromatography, immunoassays, and biosynthetic labeling. Extracts of rat
  intermediate pituitary contain primarily alpha-N,O-diacetyl-ACTH(1-13)NH2, with
  smaller amounts of des- and monoacetyl-ACTH(1-13)NH2. No significant amount of ACTH(1-14)OH-
  or ACTH(1-13)OH-related material was observed. Analysis of the newly synthesized
  alpha MSH-sized peptides produced by freshly prepared rat intermediate pituitary
  cell suspensions revealed labeled peptides co-migrating primarily with des-, mono-,
  and diacetyl-ACTH(1-13)NH2. In contrast, when extracts of 2-week-old intermediate
  pituitary cultures were analyzed, the major peak of material detected with the general
  NH2-terminal ACTH antiserum eluted at the position expected for alpha-N,O-diacetyl-ACTH(1-14)OH;
  smaller amounts of material co-migrating with des- and monoacetyl-ACTH(1-14)OH were
  also detected. Analysis of the newly synthesized alpha MSH-sized peptides produced
  by 16-day-old cultures of intermediate pituitary cells revealed labeled peptides
  co-migrating with des-, mono-, and diacetyl-ACTH(1-14)OH. Thus, rat intermediate
  pituitary cells in culture maintain the ability to perform several major proteolytic
  cleavages of pro-ACTH/endorphin as well as the ability to alpha-N-acetylate alpha
  MSH and beta-endorphin, but selectively lose the ability to alpha-amidate the carboxyl
  terminus of alpha MSH.
