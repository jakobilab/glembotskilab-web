abstract: The serine-threonine kinases Pim-1 and Akt regulate cellular proliferation
  and survival. Although Akt is known to be a crucial signaling protein in the myocardium,
  the role of Pim-1 has been overlooked. Pim-1 expression in the myocardium of mice
  decreased during postnatal development, re-emerged after acute pathological injury
  in mice and was increased in failing hearts of both mice and humans. Cardioprotective
  stimuli associated with Akt activation induced Pim-1 expression, but compensatory
  increases in Akt abundance and phosphorylation after pathological injury by infarction
  or pressure overload did not protect the myocardium in Pim-1-deficient mice. Transgenic
  expression of Pim-1 in the myocardium protected mice from infarction injury, and
  Pim-1 expression inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis with concomitant increases in
  Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) protein levels, as well as in Bad phosphorylation levels. Relative
  to nontransgenic controls, calcium dynamics were significantly enhanced in Pim-1-overexpressing
  transgenic hearts, associated with increased expression of SERCA2a, and were depressed
  in Pim-1-deficient hearts. Collectively, these data suggest that Pim-1 is a crucial
  facet of cardioprotection downstream of Akt.
