abstract: The subcellular localization of the post-translational processing steps
  which occur in the conversion of pro-adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)/endorphin
  into beta-endorphin-sized molecules in rat intermediate pituitary has been studied.
  Primary cell cultures were incubated in radioactively labeled amino acids, and a
  subcellular fraction containing secretory granules was separated from a subcellular
  fraction containing rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus by centrifugation
  of homogenates on gradients on Percoll (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals). The radiolabeled
  beta-endorphin-related material in the granule and rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi
  apparatus fractions was quantitated by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate
  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A pulse-chase labeling experiment demonstrated
  that newly synthesized beta-endorphin-related material first appeared in the rough
  endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus fraction and after longer incubations (chase)
  appeared in the secretory granule fraction. After 2 h of chase incubation, about
  85% of the beta-endorphin-related material synthesized during the 30-min pulse incubation
  had been transferred from the rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus to the
  secretory granule fraction. The conversion of most of the newly synthesized pro-ACTH/endorphin
  into beta-lipotropin occurred in the rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus
  fraction, whereas the conversion of most of the beta-lipotropin into beta-endorphin-sized
  molecules occurred in the secretory granule fraction.
