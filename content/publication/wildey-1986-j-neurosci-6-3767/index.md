abstract: Binding sites for 125I-atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)2 in rat olfactory
  bulb membranes have been studied using pharmacological and biochemical methods.
  Various unlabeled ANP-related peptides were tested for the ability to inhibit the
  binding of the radioligand in membrane binding assays. ANP(92-126) and ANP(99-126)
  were the most potent inhibitors tested, both exhibiting an IC50 value of 0.40 nM.
  ANP(103-126) and ANP(103-123) were 3 and 70 times less potent, respectively. ANP(111-126)
  was unable to inhibit the binding of the radioligand at a concentration of 1 microM.
  Several peptides unrelated to ANP were unable to inhibit the binding of the radioligand
  to rat olfactory bulb membranes. Membranes labeled with 125I-ANP were incubated
  with cross-linking agents and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.
  A band possessing an apparent molecular mass of 116 kDa was identified. The labeling
  of this band was progressively decreased by increasing concentrations of unlabeled
  ANP(99-126) (IC50 = 0.6 nM) and by several other ANP-related peptides at nanomolar
  concentrations. For comparison purposes, ANP binding sites in rat aorta membranes
  were labeled with 125I-ANP and cross-linked using identical techniques. Three bands
  possessing molecular masses of 120, 72, and 62 kDa were identified. These results
  indicate that the ANP binding site in rat olfactory bulb membranes displays pharmacological
  and biochemical properties similar to peripheral ANP receptors.
