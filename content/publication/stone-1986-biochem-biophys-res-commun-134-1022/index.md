abstract: Acid extracts of rat anterior uvea and retina contain immunoactive atrial
  natriuretic peptide. Gel filtration chromatography demonstrates that the major forms
  of the uveal and retinal material have approximate molecular weights of 2400 and
  1750 daltons respectively, similar in size to the hypothalamic form of the peptide
  but clearly distinguishable from the larger, cardiac form. When further analyzed
  by RP-HPLC, the immunoactive material from both ocular tissues elutes at a position
  similar to atrial natriuretic peptide-28, again distinguishing the ocular and cardiac
  forms of immunoactive material. These results suggest potential roles for atrial
  natriuretic peptide both in ocular vegetative physiology and in retinal function.
