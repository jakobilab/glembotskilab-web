 abstract = {Endothelin (ET), a potent stimulator of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) secretion in atrial myocyte cultures, has been hypothesized to act via the stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC). This study was carried out in order to determine if ET activates PKC in atrial cultures and whether this activation fully accounts for the effects of ET on ANF secretion. By monitoring the phosphorylation of p80 upon exposure to phorbol ester or ET, it was shown that ET activated PKC in atrial cultures, but to a lesser extent than phorbol ester. In contrast, ET stimulated ANF secretion to a level five times greater than phorbol ester, indicating that PKC activation alone does not fully account for the effects of ET on ANF secretion. Down-regulation of PKC or exposure to the PKC inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H7) resulted in a 50% decrease in ET-stimulated ANF secretion. Interestingly, increasing calcium influx with BAY K 8644 stimulated ANF secretion but did not effect the phosphorylation of p80, indicating a PKC-independent pathway of ANF secretion. Similarly, a component of ET-stimulated secretion that required calcium influx was independent of PKC activation but was sensitive to the Ca2+/calmodulin kinase (CaMK) inhibitor KN-62. Complete inhibition of ET-mediated ANF secretion was obtained only in the presence of both H7 and KN-62. These results demonstrate that ET activates PKC in atrial myocyte cultures and that the full effects of ET on ANF secretion require both PKC and Ca2+/calmodulin kinase activities.},
