abstract: Endothelin (ET), a potent stimulator of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)
  secretion in atrial myocyte cultures, has been hypothesized to act via the stimulation
  of protein kinase C (PKC). This study was carried out in order to determine if ET
  activates PKC in atrial cultures and whether this activation fully accounts for
  the effects of ET on ANF secretion. By monitoring the phosphorylation of p80 upon
  exposure to phorbol ester or ET, it was shown that ET activated PKC in atrial cultures,
  but to a lesser extent than phorbol ester. In contrast, ET stimulated ANF secretion
  to a level five times greater than phorbol ester, indicating that PKC activation
  alone does not fully account for the effects of ET on ANF secretion. Down-regulation
  of PKC or exposure to the PKC inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine
  dihydrochloride (H7) resulted in a 50% decrease in ET-stimulated ANF secretion.
  Interestingly, increasing calcium influx with BAY K 8644 stimulated ANF secretion
  but did not effect the phosphorylation of p80, indicating a PKC-independent pathway
  of ANF secretion. Similarly, a component of ET-stimulated secretion that required
  calcium influx was independent of PKC activation but was sensitive to the Ca2+/calmodulin
  kinase (CaMK) inhibitor KN-62. Complete inhibition of ET-mediated ANF secretion
  was obtained only in the presence of both H7 and KN-62. These results demonstrate
  that ET activates PKC in atrial myocyte cultures and that the full effects of ET
  on ANF secretion require both PKC and Ca2+/calmodulin kinase activities.
