abstract: Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is stored in atrial myocytes as a prohormone
  (ANF-(1-126] and is cosecretionally processed to the circulating ANF-related peptides,
  ANF-(1-98) and ANF-(99-126). Recently, we have shown that the cosecretional processing
  of ANF can be replicated in primary cultures of neonatal rat atrial myocytes maintained
  under serum-free conditions and that glucocorticoids are responsible for supporting
  this processing activity. Activators of protein kinase C (phorbol esters and alpha-adrenergic
  agonists) and of protein kinase A (cAMP analogs, forskolin, and beta-adrenergic
  agonists) were tested for their abilities to alter the rate of ANF secretion from
  the primary cultures. ANF secretion was stimulated approximately 4-fold after a
  1-h incubation of the cultures with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol
  13-acetate (TPA); maximal release occurred at about 100 nM TPA. Reversed-phase high
  performance liquid chromatography analysis of secreted material indicated that the
  cells efficiently cosecretionally processed ANF under both basal and TPA-stimulated
  conditions. However, incubating the cultures for more than 1 h with TPA resulted
  in a blunted secretory response to further TPA challenge and a 40-50% decrease in
  the quantity of ANF in the cells. The alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine
  was also capable of stimulating ANF secretion by about 4-fold at a half-maximal
  dose of about 1 microM. Phenylephrine-stimulated ANF secretion was inhibited by
  the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin with half-maximal inhibition occurring
  at approximately 1 nM. Forskolin, 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, and
  N6-2(1)-O-dibutyryladenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate inhibited basal, TPA- and
  phenylephrine-stimulated ANF secretion. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol
  partially inhibited phenylephrine-stimulated ANF secretion with the maximal effect
  occurring at 1 nM. These results indicate that ANF secretion from the neonatal rat
  atrial cultures is enhanced by activators of protein kinase C, and decreased by
  activators of protein kinase A, and that these secretory effects may be mediated
  through the actions of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, respectively.
