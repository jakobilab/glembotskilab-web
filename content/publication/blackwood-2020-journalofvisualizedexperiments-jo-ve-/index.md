abstract: The isolation and culturing of cardiac myocytes from mice has been essential
  for furthering the understanding of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. While
  isolating myocytes from neonatal mouse hearts is relatively straightforward, myocytes
  from the adult murine heart are preferred. This is because compared to neonatal
  cells, adult myocytes more accurately recapitulate cell function as it occurs in
  the adult heart in vivo. However, it is technically difficult to isolate adult mouse
  cardiac myocytes in the necessary quantities and viability, which contributes to
  an experimental impasse. Furthermore, published procedures are specific for the
  isolation of either atrial or ventricular myocytes at the expense of atrial and
  ventricular non-myocyte cells. Described here is a detailed method for isolating
  both atrial and ventricular cardiac myocytes, along with atrial and ventricular
  non-myocytes, simultaneously from a single mouse heart. Also provided are the details
  for optimal cell-specific culturing methods, which enhance cell viability and function.
  This protocol aims not only to expedite the process of adult murine cardiac cell
  isolation, but also to increase the yield and viability of cells for investigations
  of atrial and ventricular cardiac cells.
