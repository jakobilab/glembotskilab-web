abstract: In the present study, it was shown that physiologically relevant levels
  of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha induced apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes
  in vitro, as quantified by single cell microgel electrophoresis of nuclei (\"cardiac
  comets\") as well as by morphological and biochemical criteria. It was also shown
  that TNFalpha stimulated production of the endogenous second messenger, sphingosine,
  suggesting sphingolipid involvement in TNFalpha-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
  Consistent with this hypothesis, sphingosine strongly induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
  The ability of the appropriate stimulus to drive cardiomyocytes into apoptosis indicated
  that these cells were primed for apoptosis and were susceptible to clinically relevant
  apoptotic triggers, such as TNFalpha. These findings suggest that the elevated TNFalpha
  levels seen in a variety of clinical conditions, including sepsis and ischemic myocardial
  disorders, may contribute to TNFalpha-induced cardiac cell death. Cardiomyocyte
  apoptosis is also discussed in terms of its potential beneficial role in limiting
  the area of cardiac cell involvement as a consequence of myocardial infarction,
  viral infection, and primary cardiac tumors.
