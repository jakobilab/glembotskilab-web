abstract: Acid extracts of rat hypothalamus and atrium were prepared by a procedure
  previously shown to minimize proteolytic degradation of peptides. The majority of
  the immunoactive material in the atrial extracts had a molecular weight of approximately
  9,000 to 15,000 daltons, while that in the hypothalamic extracts had a molecular
  weight of about 1,500 to 1,800 daltons. The major molecular weight forms of atrial
  natriuretic peptide from each extract were further distinguishable when analyzed
  by RP-HPLC. These results suggest that small peptides such as atriopeptins I, II,
  and III, may not be authentic post-translational processing products in the atrium,
  and that the hypothalamus and atrium may differentially cleave pro-atrial natriuretic
  peptide to form tissue-specific products.
