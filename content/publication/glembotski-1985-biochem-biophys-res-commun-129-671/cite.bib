 abstract = {Acid extracts of rat hypothalamus and atrium were prepared by a procedure previously shown to minimize proteolytic degradation of peptides. The majority of the immunoactive material in the atrial extracts had a molecular weight of approximately 9,000 to 15,000 daltons, while that in the hypothalamic extracts had a molecular weight of about 1,500 to 1,800 daltons. The major molecular weight forms of atrial natriuretic peptide from each extract were further distinguishable when analyzed by RP-HPLC. These results suggest that small peptides such as atriopeptins I, II, and III, may not be authentic post-translational processing products in the atrium, and that the hypothalamus and atrium may differentially cleave pro-atrial natriuretic peptide to form tissue-specific products.},
