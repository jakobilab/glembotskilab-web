abstract: The naturally occurring second messenger sphingosine (SPH) was examined
  for its ability to influence cardiac myocyte Ca2+ regulation. SPH inhibited intracellular
  Ca2+ transients in adult and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The inhibition was
  steeply dose dependent, with complete blockage of the Ca2+ transients occurring
  in the 20- to 25-mumol/L range. Whole-cell patch clamping revealed substantial inhibition
  of the L-type Ca2+ channel current (ICa) by SPH. The ability of SPH to block both
  the Ca2+ transients and ICa was not dependent on protein kinases, since the general
  protein kinase inhibitor H7 failed to prevent the actions of SPH. The specificity
  of the effect of SPH was determined in experiments showing that SPH analogues did
  not produce comparable effects. Neither the naturally occurring ceramide, N-stearoyl
  SPH, nor the cell-permeant ceramide, N-acetyl SPH, had SPH-like actions on the Ca2+
  transients or L-type channel conductances. Caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients were
  also inhibited by the actions of SPH on cardiac sarcoplamic reticulum Ca2+ release,
  and the threshold for caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was raised. We conclude that
  SPH inhibits excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes by reducing the
  amount of entering \"trigger Ca2+\" for Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release and by simultaneously
  raising the threshold of the ryanodine receptor for Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release.
  Consequently, we propose that sphingolipids produced by the sphingomyelin signal
  transduction pathway could be physiologically relevant regulators of cardiac [Ca2+]i
  and therefore cardiac contractility.
