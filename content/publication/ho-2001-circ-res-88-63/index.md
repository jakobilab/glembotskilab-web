abstract: Heart failure is associated with dysregulation of intracellular calcium
  ([Ca(2+)](i)), reduction in myofibrils, and increased activation of Ras, a regulator
  of signal-transduction pathways. To evaluate the potential effects of Ras on [Ca(2+)](i),
  we expressed constitutively active Ras (Ha-Ras(V12)) in cardiac myocytes and monitored
  [Ca(2+)](i) via fluorescence and electrophysiological techniques. Ha-Ras(V12) reduced
  the magnitude of the contractile calcium transients. Unexpectedly, however, calcium
  loading of the sarcoplasmic reticulum was increased, suggesting that Ha-Ras(V12)
  introduces a defect in excitation-calcium release coupling. Consistent with this
  idea, L-channel calcium currents were reduced by Ha-Ras(V12), which also downregulated
  the activity of the L-channel gene promoter. Coexpression of L-channels and SERCA2
  largely corrected Ha-Ras(V12)-induced dysregulation of [Ca(2+)](i). Furthermore,
  whereas Ha-Ras(V12) downregulated myofibrils, this effect was blocked by coexpression
  of L-channels. These results suggest that Ras downregulates L-channel expression,
  which may play a pathophysiological role in cardiac disease.
