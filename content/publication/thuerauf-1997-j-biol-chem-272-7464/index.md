abstract: The cardiac genes for the A- and B-type natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP)
  are coordinately induced by growth promoters, such as alpha1-adrenergic receptor
  agonists (e.g. phenylephrine (PE)). Although inducible elements in the ANP gene
  have been identified, responsible elements in the BNP gene are unknown. In this
  study, reporter constructs transfected into neonatal rat ventricular myocytes showed
  that in the context of 2.5 kilobase pairs of native BNP 5'-flanking sequences, a
  2-base pair mutation in a promoter-proximal M-CAT site (CATTCT) disrupted basal
  and PE-inducible transcription by more than 98%. Expression of constitutively active
  forms of Ras, Raf-1 kinase, and protein kinase C, all of which are activated by
  PE in cardiac myocytes, strongly stimulated BNP reporter expression. Isolated M-CAT
  elements conferred PE, protein kinase C, and Ras inducibility to a minimal BNP promoter,
  however, they did not confer Raf-1 inducibility. These results show that M-CAT elements
  can serve as targets for Ras-dependent, Raf-1-independent pathways, implying the
  involvement of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and/or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases,
  but not extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase/mitogen-activated protein
  kinase. Moreover, the essential M-CAT element distinguishes the BNP gene from the
  ANP gene, which utilizes serum response elements and an Sp1-like sequence.
