abstract: Diabetes is a multi-organ disease and diabetic cardiomyopathy can result
  in heart failure, which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic
  patients. In the liver, insulin resistance contributes to hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia,
  which further worsens the metabolic profile. Defects in mTOR signalling are believed
  to contribute to metabolic dysfunctions in diabetic liver and hearts, but evidence
  is missing that mTOR activation is causal to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.
  This study shows that specific mTORC1 inhibition by PRAS40 prevents the development
  of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This phenotype was associated with improved metabolic
  function, blunted hypertrophic growth and preserved cardiac function. In addition
  PRAS40 treatment improves hepatic insulin sensitivity and reduces systemic hyperglycaemia
  in obese mice. Thus, unlike rapamycin, mTORC1 inhibition with PRAS40 improves metabolic
  profile in diabetic mice. These findings may open novel avenues for therapeutic
  strategies using PRAS40 directed against diabetic-related diseases.
