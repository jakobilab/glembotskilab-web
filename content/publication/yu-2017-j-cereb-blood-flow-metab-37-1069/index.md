abstract: Impaired function of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER stress) is a hallmark
  of many human diseases including stroke. To restore ER function in stressed cells,
  the unfolded protein response (UPR) is induced, which activates 3 ER stress sensor
  proteins including activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). ATF6 is then cleaved
  by proteases to form the short-form ATF6 (sATF6), a transcription factor. To determine
  the extent to which activation of the ATF6 UPR branch defines the fate and function
  of neurons after stroke, we generated a conditional and tamoxifen-inducible sATF6
  knock-in mouse. To express sATF6 in forebrain neurons, we crossed our sATF6 knock-in
  mouse line with Emx1-Cre mice to generate ATF6-KI mice. After the ATF6 branch was
  activated in ATF6-KI mice with tamoxifen, mice were subjected to transient middle
  cerebral artery occlusion. Forced activation of the ATF6 UPR branch reduced infarct
  volume and improved functional outcome at 24,h after stroke. Increased autophagic
  activity at early reperfusion time after stroke may contribute to the ATF6-mediated
  neuroprotection. We concluded that the ATF6 UPR branch is crucial to ischemic stroke
  outcome. Therefore, boosting UPR pro-survival pathways may be a promising therapeutic
  strategy for stroke.
