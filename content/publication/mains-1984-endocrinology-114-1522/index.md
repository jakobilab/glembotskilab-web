abstract: Mouse anterior pituitary corticotropic tumor cells (AtT-20/D-16v) were homogenized
  and subjected to subcellular fractionation. A secretory granule associated enzyme
  activity was detected which could convert D-Tyr-Val-Gly into D-Tyr-Val-NH2. The
  enzyme activity was dependent on the presence of molecular oxygen, copper ions,
  and reduced ascorbate. Potent endogenous inhibitors of the enzyme obscured the activity
  unless appropriate levels of copper ions were added. The production of radiolabeled
  D-Tyr-Val-NH2 from labeled D-Tyr-Val-Gly was inhibited by a wide variety of peptides
  possessing COOH-terminal glycine residues but not by a number of other peptides,
  suggesting that many peptides with COOH-terminal glycine residues can function as
  substrates in the alpha-amidation reaction. Kinetic studies with varied concentrations
  of D-Tyr-Val-Gly demonstrated Michaelis-Menten kinetics; both the Km for D-Tyr-Val-Gly
  and maximum velocity (Vmax) increased upon addition of ascorbate to the reaction.
  Under optimized assay conditions, the secretory granule pool contains enough alpha-amidation
  activity to alpha-amidate all the relevant peptides in granules in a small fraction
  of the total time required for complete biosynthetic processing. Secretion of alpha-amidation
  activity was stimulated along with secretion of pro-ACTH/endorphin-derived peptides
  upon addition of synthetic corticotropin releasing factor or 8-bromo-cAMP.
