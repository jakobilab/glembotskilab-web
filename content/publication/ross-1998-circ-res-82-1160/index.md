abstract: Multiple signaling pathways have been implicated in the hypertrophic response
  of ventricular myocytes, yet the importance of cell-matrix interactions has not
  been extensively examined. Integrins are cell-surface molecules that link the extracellular
  matrix to the cellular cytoskeleton. They can function as cell signaling molecules
  and transducers of mechanical information in noncardiac cells. Given these properties
  and their abundance in cardiac cells, we evaluated the hypothesis that beta1 integrin
  function is involved in the alpha1-adrenergic mediated hypertrophic response of
  neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The hypertrophic response of this model required
  interaction with extracellular matrix proteins. Specificity of these results was
  confirmed by demonstrating that ventricular myocytes plated onto an anti-beta1 integrin
  antibody supported the hypertrophic gene response. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression
  of beta1 integrin augmented the myocyte hypertrophic response when assessed by protein
  synthesis and atrial natriuretic factor production, a marker gene of hypertrophic
  induction. DNA synthesis was not altered by integrin overexpression. Transfection
  of cultured cardiac myocytes with either the ubiquitously expressed beta1A integrin
  or the cardiac/skeletal muscle-specific beta1 isoform (beta1D) activated reporter
  expression from both the atrial natriuretic factor and myosin light chain-2 ventricular
  promoters, genetic markers of ventricular cell hypertrophy. Finally, suppression
  of integrin signaling by overexpression of free beta1 integrin cytoplasmic domains
  inhibited the adrenergically mediated atrial natriuretic factor response. These
  findings show that integrin ligation and signaling are involved in the cardiac hypertrophic
  response pathway.
