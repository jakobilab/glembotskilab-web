abstract: An enzymatic activity capable of producing an alpha-amidated peptide product
  from its glycine-extended precursor has been identified in secretory granules of
  rat anterior, intermediate, and neural pituitary and bovine intermediate pituitary.
  High levels of endogenous inhibitors of this alpha-amidation activity have also
  been found in tissue homogenates. The alpha-amidation activity is totally inhibited
  by addition of divalent metal ion chelators such as diethyldithiocarbamate, o-phenanthroline,
  and EDTA; alpha-amidation activity is restored to above control levels upon addition
  of copper. The alpha-amidation reaction requires the presence of molecular oxygen.
  Of the various cofactors tested, ascorbic acid was the most potent stimulator of
  alpha-amidation. The alpha-amidation activity has a neutral pH optimum and is primarily
  soluble following several cycles of freezing and thawing. Kinetic studies with the
  bovine intermediate pituitary granule-associated activity demonstrated a linear
  Lineweaver-Burk plot when D-Tyr-Val-Gly was the varied substrate; the apparent Km
  and Vmax varied with the concentration of ascorbic acid. The substrate specificity
  of the alpha-amidation activity appears to be quite broad; the conversion of D-Tyr-Val-Gly
  into D-Tyr-Val-NH2 is inhibited by the addition of a variety of glycine-extended
  peptides.
