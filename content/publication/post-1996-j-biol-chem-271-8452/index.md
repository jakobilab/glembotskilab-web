abstract: In response to hormones and mechanical stretch, neonatal rat ventricular
  myocytes exhibit a hypertrophic response that is characterized by induction of cardiac-specific
  genes and increased myocardial cell size. Hypertrophic stimuli also activate mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), an enzyme thought to play a central role in the regulation
  of cell growth and differentiation. To determine if MAPK activation is sufficient
  for acquisition of the molecular and morphological features of cardiac hypertrophy
  we compared four agonists that stimulate G protein-coupled receptors. Whereas phenylephrine
  and endothelin transactivate cardiac-specific promoter/luciferase reporter genes,
  increase atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) expression, and promote myofilament organization,
  neither carbachol nor ATP induces these responses. Interestingly, all four agonists
  activate both the p42 and the p44 isoforms of MAPK. Furthermore, the kinetics of
  MAPK activation are not different for the hypertrophic agonist phenylephrine and
  the nonhypertrophic agonist carbachol. Transient transfection of myocytes with dominant-interfering
  mutants of p42 and p44 MAPK failed to block phenylephrine-induced ANF expression,
  although Ras-induced gene expression was inhibited by expression of the mutant MAPK
  constructs. Moreover, PD 098059, an inhibitor of MAPK kinase, blocked phenylephrine-stimulated
  MAPK activity but not ANF reporter gene expression. Thus, MAPK activation is not
  sufficient for G protein receptor-mediated induction of cardiac cell growth and
  gene expression and is apparently not required for transcriptional activation of
  the ANF gene.
