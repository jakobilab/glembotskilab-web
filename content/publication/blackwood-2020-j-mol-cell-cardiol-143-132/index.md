abstract: The effects of ER stress on protein secretion by cardiac myocytes are not
  well understood. In this study, the ER stressor thapsigargin (TG), which depletes
  ER calcium, induced death of cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs)
  in high media volume but fostered protection in low media volume. In contrast, another
  ER stressor, tunicamycin (TM), a protein glycosylation inhibitor, induced NRVM death
  in all media volumes, suggesting that protective proteins were secreted in response
  to TG but not TM. Proteomic analyses of TG- and TM-conditioned media showed that
  the secretion of most proteins was inhibited by TG and TM; however, secretion of
  several ER-resident proteins, including GRP78 was increased by TG but not TM. Simulated
  ischemia, which decreases ER/SR calcium also increased secretion of these proteins.
  Mechanistically, secreted GRP78 was shown to enhance survival of NRVMs by collaborating
  with a cell-surface protein, CRIPTO, to activate protective AKT signaling and to
  inhibit death-promoting SMAD2 signaling. Thus, proteins secreted during ER stress
  mediated by ER calcium depletion can enhance cardiac myocyte viability.
