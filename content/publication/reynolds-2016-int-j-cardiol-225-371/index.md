abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Junctophilin-2 (JPH2) is the primary structural protein for
  the coupling of transverse (T)-tubule associated cardiac L-type Ca channels and
  type-2 ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum within junctional membrane
  complexes (JMCs) in cardiomyocytes. Effective signaling between these channels ensures
  adequate Ca-induced Ca release required for normal cardiac contractility. Disruption
  of JMC subcellular domains, a common feature of failing hearts, has been attributed
  to JPH2 downregulation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that adeno-associated virus
  type 9 (AAV9) mediated overexpression of JPH2 could halt the development of heart
  failure in a mouse model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC). METHODS AND RESULTS:
  Following TAC, a progressive decrease in ejection fraction was paralleled by a progressive
  decrease of cardiac JPH2 levels. AAV9-mediated expression of JPH2 rescued cardiac
  contractility in mice subjected to TAC. AAV9-JPH2 also preserved T-tubule structure.
  Moreover, the Ca(2+) spark frequency was reduced and the Ca(2+) transient amplitude
  was increased in AAV9-JPH2 mice following TAC, consistent with JPH2-mediated normalization
  of SR Ca(2+) handling. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that AAV9-mediated JPH2
  gene therapy maintained cardiac function in mice with early stage heart failure.
  Moreover, restoration of JPH2 levels prevented loss of T-tubules and suppressed
  abnormal SR Ca(2+) leak associated with contractile failure following TAC. These
  findings suggest that targeting JPH2 might be an attractive therapeutic approach
  for treating pathological cardiac remodeling during heart failure.'
