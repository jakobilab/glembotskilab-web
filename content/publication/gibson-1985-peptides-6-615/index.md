abstract: ACTH(1-8) and ACTH(9-13)NH2 were used as potential enzyme inhibitors to
  begin examining the relationship between the acetylation of ACTH- and beta-endorphin-related
  peptides. ACTH(1-8) was a potent inhibitor of the acetylation of both ACTH- and
  beta-endorphin-related peptides, whereas ACTH(9-13)NH2 was an effective inhibitor
  only of the acetylation of ACTH-related substrates. This inhibition pattern indicated
  that there may be an unusual interaction between some ACTH- and beta-endorphin-related
  peptides as substrates for the acetyltransferase. Utilizing HPLC to separate ACTH-
  and beta-endorphin-related peptides present in the same reaction mixture, ACTH(1-14)
  and beta-endorphin(1-27) at Km and saturating concentrations were used as substrates
  to examine the ability of one peptide substrate to affect the acetylation of the
  other. It was observed that the acetylation of ACTH(1-14), even at Km concentration,
  was relatively unaffected by the presence of beta-endorphin(1-27). However, the
  acetylation of beta-endorphin(1-27) was significantly reduced by the presence of
  ACTH(1-14). This preferential acetylation of ACTH-related peptides over the acetylation
  of beta-endorphin-related peptides might have physiological importance under some
  conditions.
