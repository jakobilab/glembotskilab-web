abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction is followed by cardiac dysfunction, cellular
  death, and ventricular remodeling, including tissue fibrosis. S100A4 protein plays
  multiple roles in cellular survival, and tissue fibrosis, but the relative role
  of the S100A4 in the myocardium after myocardial infarction is unknown. This study
  aims to investigate the role of S100A4 in myocardial remodeling and cardiac function
  following infarct damage. METHODS AND RESULTS: S100A4 expression is low in the adult
  myocardium, but significantly increased following myocardial infarction. Deletion
  of S100A4 increased cardiac damage after myocardial infarction, whereas cardiac
  myocyte-specific overexpression of S100A4 protected the infarcted myocardium. Decreased
  cardiac function in S100A4 Knockout mice was accompanied with increased cardiac
  remodeling, fibrosis, and diminished capillary density in the remote myocardium.
  Loss of S100A4 caused increased apoptotic cell death both in vitro and in vivo in
  part mediated by decreased VEGF expression. Conversely, S100A4 overexpression protected
  cells against apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Increased pro-survival AKT-signaling
  explained reduced apoptosis in S100A4 overexpressing cells. CONCLUSION: S100A4 expression
  protects cardiac myocytes against myocardial ischemia and is required for stabilization
  of cardiac function after MI.'
