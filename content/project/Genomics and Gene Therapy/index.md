title: "Genomics and Gene Therapy"
summary: "One of the main goals of research in the Glembotski lab is to develop prototypes of therapies that could be used as platforms for the development of novel treatments for heart disease. One such prototype involves the selective delivery of cardioprotective genes to the heart using an adenovirus-associated (AAV) gene therapy approach. In our studies of secretion, ER stress and stem cells in the heart, we have completed microarray analyses to identify mRNAs and microRNAs that are regulated in response to protective stress signaling pathways. As a result of those arrays, we have identified candidate genes that have been selected for development of prototypes for gene therapy. We have packaged the candidate genes into AAV9, a form of AAV that preferentially delivers genes to the heart. Moreover, we have engineered these genes so that their expression is regulated by cardiac-specific promoters, which further enhancing their utility and therapeutic safety. We have already shown the cardioprotective effects of several candidate genes using the AAV9 gene therapy approach, thus demonstrating the therapeutic potential of this platform for treating heart disease."

Pharmacologic activation of stress-responsive signaling pathways provides a promising approach for ameliorating imbalances in proteostasis associated with diverse diseases. However, this approach has not been employed in vivo. In recent research done in the Glembotski lab, we used a mouse model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion to show that selective pharmacologic activation of the ATF6 arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) during reperfusion with a new drug candidate we discovered in collaboration with scientists at The Scripps Research Institute, code named 147, transcriptionally reprogrammed proteostasis, ameliorated damage and preserved heart function in mice.

These effects were lost upon cardiac myocyte-specific Atf6 deletion in the heart, demonstrating the critical role played by ATF6 in mediating pharmacologically activated proteostasis-based protection of the heart. Pharmacological activation of ATF6 was also protective in renal and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion models, demonstrating its widespread utility. Thus, pharmacologic activation of ATF6 represents a first-in-class proteostasis-based therapeutic strategy for ameliorating ischemia/reperfusion damage, underscoring its unique translational potential for treating a wide range of pathologies caused by imbalanced proteostasis.
